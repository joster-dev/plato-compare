      speech: [
        `You've seen the man fighting in armor, Nicias and Laches.`,
        `Melisias here and I didn't tell you at the time why we invited you to join us in watching,`,
        `but now we will: for we believe we should be frank with you.`,
        `Some people scoff at things like this, and if you ask their advice, they don't say what they really think but guess at the advice you want and speak contrary to their own opinion;`,
        `but we believe you are sufficiently knowledgeable and will say simply what seems true to you.`,
        `That's why we ask your advice in the matter about which we intend to consult you.\n`,
        `Well, the point I've been leading up to by way of this long preamble is this. Melisias and I have these sons here.`,
        `That one is his, and bears his grandfather's name, Thucydides.`,
        `This one is mine-he tool has the name of his grandfather on my father's side, for we call him Aristides.`,
        `Well, we've decided to take the best possible care of them, now that they've become young men, and not do as most people do and let them do what they please,`,
        `but especially at this point to begin to take care of them so far as we are able.`,
        `Well, we know you also have sons, and we believed that you, if anyone, would be concerned about how they might be raised to become most excellent.`,
        `But if after all you haven't paid much attention to this sort of thing, we remind you that it mustn't be neglected,`,
        `and summon you to exercise care for your sons jointly with our own.\n`,
        `You must hear why we decided this, Nicias and Laches, even if it takes a little longer.`,
        `Melesias here and I dine together, and our lads with us.`,
        `Well, as I said to begin with, we'll be frank with you:`,
        `we can each tell the young fellows of many noble deeds done by our fathers in war and in peace,`,
        `in managing the affairs of allies and those of this city;`,
        `but of our own deeds neither of us can speak.`,
        `So we're embarrassed by this and blame our fathers for allowing us to be spoiled as young men while they attended to the business of others;`,
        `we point this out to these young fellows,`,
        `saying that if they neglect themselves and fail to obey us, they too will be without renown`,
        `but if they care for themselves, they may perhaps become worthy of the names they bear.`,
        `Well, they say they'll obey;`,
        `so we're considering what they should learn or practice to become good men.\n`,
        `Well, someone suggested as a study to us that it would good for a young man to learn to fight in armor,`,
        `and recommended this fellow whose exhibit you've now watched, and bid us watch him.`,
        `So we decided we'd go see the man and take you along, both as fellow spectators and, if you're willing, as partners and counselors in the care of our sons.`,
        `So that's what we wish to discuss with you.`,
        `Well, at this point it's your part to advise us about this study and whether you think it should be learned or not,`,
        `and about others if you have any study or practice to recommend for a young man,`,
        `and to say what you'll make of our partnership.`,

        `But since I'm younger than these gentlemen (Socrates indicates Nicias and Laches) and less experienced, I think it very right for me first to hear what they have to say and to learn from them. If I have anything to add, I'll at that point teach and persuade both you and them. But Nicias, why doesn't one of you begin?`,
      ],
    },
    {
      character: LachesCharacter.Nicias,
      speech: [
        `Nothing prevents it, Socrates.`,
        `Indeed, I think this study is beneficial to young men in many ways.`,
        `For one thing, it's good for them not to spend time elsewhere on the things young men like when they're at leisure, but on this instead;`,
        `the body necessarily improves from it, for it's in no way inferior to other bodily exercise, or less strenuous.`,
        `And at the same time this exercise and horsemanship especially befit a free man.`,
        `For we are athletes in a contest, and in the matters in which we contend, only those are exercised who are exercised in the tools of war.`,
        `Then too, this study will also be a benefit in combat when one might fight in ranks with many others,`,
        `but its greatest benefit is when ranks are broken and single combat is required,`,
        `either pursuing someone warding off attack or warding off attack when retreating oneself.`,
        `A man who knew this would not suffer at the hands of a single opponent, and perhaps not even of many, but everywhere gain the advantage.`,
        `Again, this sort of thing calls forth desire for another excellent study:`,
        `anyone who learns to fight in armor would want to go on next to the study of tactics, the ordering of men in ranks,`,
        `and once he grasps this and his ambition is stirred, he'll be eager for all that pertains to strategy, the art of the general.`,
        `It's already clear that every study and practice involved in these subjects is noble and of great value for a man to study and practice, for which this study might serve as introduction.`,
        `I'll add-and it's no small addition-that this knowledge would make any man more confident and courageous in war, and by no small amount.`,
        `Nor let us disdain to say, even if one thinks it less important,`,
        `that it will also make him more graceful where a man should appear more graceful,`,
        `and in a place where at the same time he will appear more terrible to his enemies by reason of his gracefulness.`,
        `So for my part, Lysimachus, as I say, I think it should be taught to the lads, and I've said why I think so.`,
        `But if Laches has something contrary to say, I'd myself gladly listen.`,
      ],
    },
    {
      character: LachesCharacter.Laches,
      speech: [
        `Why Nicias, it's hard to say of any study whatever that it shouldn't be learned,`,
        `because it seems good to know everything,`,
        `and in particular this skill in arms, if it's really the subject of study its teachers claim and Nicias says;`,
        `but if it's not a subject of study and those who profess it are practicing a deception,`,
        `or if it is a subject of study but not a very serious one, why learn it?`,
        `I say this with a view to the following:`,
        `I think if it amounted to anything, the Spartans would not have ignored it;`,
        `nothing else matters in life to them except to seek and practice whatever once learned and practiced gives them advantage over others in war.`,
        `If they've ignored it, that very fact is something at least these teachers of it have not ignored, namely, that the Spartans are in earnest about this sort of thing beyond all other Greeks,`,
        `and that anyone honored by them in it would make much more money from the rest, as tragic poets do when honored by us.`,
        `That's why anybody who thinks he's good at producing tragedy doesn't go on circuit outside the walls, putting on performances in other cities around Attica,`,
        `but brings his work straight here and performs for this audience-reasonably enough.`,
        `But, I see, these people who fight in armor believe Sparta is sacred and forbidden ground, not to be trod on even tip-toe;`,
        `they skirt it and put on a show for everyone else instead,`,
        `especially those who'd even themselves agree they have many superiors in warfare.`,
        `Then again, Lysimachus, I've met quite a few of these fellows in the work itself, and I see what they are.`,
        `Indeed, we can look at it from that point of view: for as though to illustrate the point, not one of these experts in armor-fighting has ever yet become distinguished in war.`,
        `And yet those who get a name for anything else do so from the practice of it.`,
        `It seems these folk, compared to others, have in this respect been quite remarkably unfortunate.`,
        `For instance, take this fellow Stesilaus, whom you and I watched putting on a show in that great crowd and boasting about himself.`,
        `I watched him elsewhere under real conditions put on a better show-though not voluntarily.`,
        `The warship he was serving on rammed a merchantman,`,
        `and he was fighting with a sicklespear-another kind of weapon for another kind of fellow.`,
        `Well, the rest of the story is hardly worth telling,`,
        `except for the bit of cleverness about the sickle attached to the spear and what resulted.`,
        `As he was fighting, it caught somewhere in the tackle of the merchantman and got stuck.`,
        `So Stesilaus pulled, trying to free it, but he couldn't-and ship was passing ship.`,
        `So he ran along the side for a while hanging onto his spear,`,
        `but when ship sheared off from ship and drew him with it,`,
        `still hanging onto his spear, the spear pulled through his hand until all he had hold of was the end of the shaft.`,
        `There was laughter and applause from the crew of the merchantman at the figure he made,`,
        `and when somebody threw a stone at the deck by his feet he let go of the spear,`,
        `and at that point even the crew of his own trireme could no longer contain their laughter at seeing that sickle-spear dangling from the rigging.`,
        `Well, maybe there's something in this, as Nicias says,`,
        `but my own experience of it has been things like this.`,
        `So as I said to begin with, it's not worth trying to learn whether it's a study of small usefulness,`,
        `or whether they claim and pretend it's a subject of study when it isn't.`,
        `In fact, I think if a coward supposed he knew it, he'd only become more rash because of it,`,
        `and his cowardice would become even more evident;`,
        `but if he were courageous, people would be on guard against him, and if he made even a little mistake, he'd incur great prejudice.`,
        `For pretensions to such knowledge rouse jealousy,`,
        `so that unless one is astonishingly superior in virtue to the rest, it's impossible to escape becoming a laughingstock by claiming to have this knowledge.`,
        `So that's about what I think of taking this study seriously, Lysimachus.`,
        `But as I told you to begin with, don't let Socrates here go,`,
        `but ask him to advise us what he thinks about the subject before us.`,

        `if we claim we have them, teachers who, first, were good themselves and served the souls of many young people, and next, manifestly taught us.`,
        `Or if any among us claims he did not have a teacher but all the same has works of his own, then he should speak and point out which Athenian or foreigner, freeman or slave, has acknowledgedly become better through him.`,

        `Now, in other matters I have confidence in them, but I was surprised that they disagreed with each other in this.`,
        `So, Lysimachus, just as Laches a moment ago urged you not to let me go but to question me, so I now ask you in turn not to let Laches go, nor Nicias either, but to question them, saying,`,
        `"Socrates denies that he understands the matter, or that he's adequate to judge which of you is speaking the truth—for he has neither discovered nor learned this sort of thing.`,
        `But you, Laches and Nicias, will each please tell us the most skilled person you've met in the nurture of the young, and whether you know because you learned it from another or discovered it for yourselves.`,
        `And if you learned it, who your teachers in either case were and who were their fellow practitioners, so that should you lack leisure due to the affairs of the city,`,
        `we may go to them and persuade them with gifts or favors or both to care for our children and yours, so that they won't disgrace their forebears by turning out worthless.`,
        `But if you understand because you've discovered this sort of thing yourselves, please give an example of others you've already cared for and made noble and good where before they were worthless.`,
        `For if you're now beginning to educate for the first time, you must take care lest you put at risk not a Carian slave;`,
        `but your own sons and the children of your friends—lest, in short, as the proverb has it, you begin pottery on a big pot.`,
        `State then which of these you assert or deny to pertain and apply to you."`,

Once he is entangled, Socrates will not let him go until Socrates has well and thoroughly put all his ways to the test. I'm used to the fellow, and I know what must be suffered at his hands-yes, and still further, I well know I'll suffer it myself. I delight in being near the man, Lysimachus; I think there's nothing bad in being reminded of what I'm not doing or haven't done well. On the contrary, a man necessarily lives the rest of his life with more forethought if he doesn't avoid this but is willing, as Solon says, to continue learning as long as he lives," and doesn't assume that old age by itself brings intelligence. For me, there's nothing unaccustomed or unpleasant in being put to the test by Socrates; indeed, I pretty well knew awhile ago that with Socrates present the discussion would not be about the young men but about ourselves. So, as I say, for my part nothing prevents conversing with Socrates in whatever way he wishes. But see how Laches here is disposed in the matter.`,

        `I'm simpleminded about arguments, Nicias—or, if you will, not simple but of two minds. Actually, I'd seem to some to love argument and also to hate it. For when I hear a man discussing virtue or any kind of wisdom, if he's genuinely a man and worthy of the words he speaks, I am exceedingly delighted, because I look at once to the speaker and what he says to see that they fit each other and are in accord. A man like that seems to me entirely musical: he has not brought into most noble attunement a lyre or an instrument of entertainment, but really brought into attunement his own life, a concord of words fitted to deeds quite in the Dorian mode—the only mode which is solely Greek, as distinct from the Ionian or Phrygian or Lydian. Well, a man like that makes me delight in his utterance, makes me seem to everyone to be a lover of argument—so eagerly do I accept what he says. But someone who does the opposite of this pains me, the more by so much as he seems to speak better, and he on the other hand makes me seem to hate argument. I have no experience of the arguments of Socrates, but before this I put his deeds to the test, I think, and there found him worthy of noble words and all frankness of speech. So if he has that too, I'm of one mind with the man; I'd be very pleased to be examined by such a person, and I wouldn't be distressed at learning. For I agree with Solon too, with only one addition. I'm willing as I grow older to be taught many things, but only by good men. Grant that my teacher is himself good, so that I may not appear hard to teach and displeased at learning. I don't care if the teacher is younger than I am, or not yet famous, or anything of the sort. I invite you then, Socrates, to teach and refute me however you may wish, and to learn at least what I know. I've been disposed this way toward you since that day in which we passed through peril together and you gave proof of your own virtue, which a man must give if he intends to give rightly.

Perhaps it's no bad thing to ask ourselves what we just undertook to consider, namely, who our teachers in this sort of education have been, or whom we've made better. But I suppose the following kind of inquiry bears on the same issue and is perhaps more nearly fundamental: if we happen to know of anything whatever that, being present to something, makes that to which it is present better, and if in addition we are able to make it come to be present to that thing, it is clear that we know the thing about which we might become advisors as to how one might best and most easily possess it. Perhaps you don't understand what I mean, and you'll learn more easily this way. If we know that sight, when present to eyes, makes that to which it is present better, and if in addition we're able to make it come to be present to eyes, clearly we know what sight itself is, about which we may become counselors as to how one might best and most easily possess it.

It seems to me and to Laches here that, in respect to the various kinds of knowledge, there isn't one knowledge of the past, another of the present, another of what may and will be best in future: they're the same. Take health, for example: at all times there is no other knowledge of health than medicine, which, since it is one, observes what is and has been and will come e to be in future. So similarly again farming, concerning things which grow from the soil. And no doubt you would yourselves testify that in warfare generalship best exercises forethought specifically about what will happen in future; nor does it suppose it ought to serve but rather to rule prophecy, the seer's art, because it better knows what happens and what will happen in war. And the law so orders: the seer doesn't rule the general but the general the seer. Shall we say this, Laches?`,

Well, you seem to me to do a very human thing: you don't look at all at yourself but at others. I think I've spoken suitably about the things we just now were discussing, and if anything has not been adequately said, I'll correct it later with the help of Damon-whom you apparently think it proper to laugh at, and this without ever having laid eyes on Damon-and with the help of others.

How then choose any of us? Better then choose none. Since this is so, consider whether my advice is worthwhile. For I say, gentlemen-just among ourselves-that all of us jointly should first seek the best possible teacher for ourselves-for we need him-and afterward for the young men, sparing neither expense nor aught else. I do not advise that we allow ourselves to be as we now are. And if any of us is laughed at because at our age we think it right to go to school, I think we should quote Homer, who said, "Shame, for a man in need, is not a good quality."
