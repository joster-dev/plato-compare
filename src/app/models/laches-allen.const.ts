      'Some people scoff at things like this, and if you ask their advice, they don\'t say what they really think but guess at the advice you want and speak contrary to their own opinion;',
      'but we believe you are sufficiently knowledgeable and will say simply what seems true to you.',
      'That\'s why we ask your advice in the matter about which we intend to consult you.\n',
      'Well, the point I\'ve been leading up to by way of this long preamble is this. Melisias and I have these sons here.',
      'That one is his, and bears his grandfather\'s name, Thucydides.',
      'This one is mine-he tool has the name of his grandfather on my father\'s side, for we call him Aristides.',
      'Well, we\'ve decided to take the best possible care of them, now that they\'ve become young men, and not do as most people do and let them do what they please,',
      'but especially at this point to begin to take care of them so far as we are able.',
      'Well, we know you also have sons, and we believed that you, if anyone, would be concerned about how they might be raised to become most excellent.',

      'You must hear why we decided this, Nicias and Laches, even if it takes a little longer.',
      'Melesias here and I dine together, and our lads with us.',
      'Well, as I said to begin with, we\'ll be frank with you:',
      'we can each tell the young fellows of many noble deeds done by our fathers in war and in peace,',
      'in managing the affairs of allies and those of this city;',
      'but of our own deeds neither of us can speak.',
      'So we\'re embarrassed by this and blame our fathers for allowing us to be spoiled as young men while they attended to the business of others;',
      'we point this out to these young fellows,',
      'saying that if they neglect themselves and fail to obey us, they too will be without renown',
      'but if they care for themselves, they may perhaps become worthy of the names they bear.',
      'Well, they say they\'ll obey;',
      'so we\'re considering what they should learn or practice to become good men.\n',
      'Well, someone suggested as a study to us that it would good for a young man to learn to fight in armor,',
      'and recommended this fellow whose exhibit you\'ve now watched, and bid us watch him.',
      'So we decided we\'d go see the man and take you along, both as fellow spectators and, if you\'re willing, as partners and counselors in the care of our sons.',
      'So that\'s what we wish to discuss with you.',
      'Well, at this point it\'s your part to advise us about this study and whether you think it should be learned or not,',
