      comment: `That the objective [of the dialogue] is beauty of every kind - first that in the sensible [realm] and in nature; then that in speeches; and [then, going] higher, that in soul and in sciences and pursuits (epitêdeumata); and [then, going] higher still, that in intellect; and finally that in gods - the first phrase [of the dialogue], my dear [Phaedrus], makes clear. For the beautiful is dear, being such that it calls [things] to itself and turns [them] towards itself. Hence it is called kalon [sc. 'beautiful'] from the fact that it calls (kalein) lovers to itself. [The next phrase] Where from and where to? is again indicative of the beauty in the sensible [realm], for sensible beauty is always in motion and in [process of] coming to be (genesis) and passing away (phthora). So, since Phaedrus had been excited by the phenomenal beauty that is in speeches, [a beauty] which is observed in [their] motion and flow (for words are the images of thoughts in the soul), and [since] all motion is from somewhere and to somewhere, [Socrates] accordingly asks where from and where to?. Or alternatively, because Socrates made it his business to care for [the welfare of] young men and someone who is going to cure something must first assess its entire condition and only then embark on the treatment, on that account too Socrates inquires what kind of company (sunousiai) he is coming from and what kind he is keen on, in case he has been corrupted by some [of that] company. Since Cephalus is presented to us in the Republic as a person who holds correct opinions (orthodoxastikos) [but lacks true knowledge] and Phaedrus was enamoured of a speech of Lysias, [the words] from Lysias, the son of Cephalus, show that phenomenal beauty is to be grasped by opinion along with sense perception and not by (14) knowledge. I'm going for a walk outside the wall shows that he is about to go to a better and higher life and, as it were, counter to (para) the many. As compared to different things or from different points of view (epibolê), the same thing can be understood either as better or as worse. For instance, if for us 'clear' (leukos) means what is manifest (saphês), what can be grasped by the senses and is very easy to make out, 'obscure' (melas) would mean what is not manifest, what is superior to sense-based knowledge, what is deep and able to be grasped only by intellection; but if 'obscure' means what is dark and confused and not manifest (in the sense of being inferior to what is manifest), then 'clear' indicates what is manifest and familiar and the light of the mind and perspicuous. So too with the town or city. Since the many dwell in it, it is clear that in Phaedrus' case I'm going outside the wall stands for '[I'm going] far from the many and the beaten track', that is, 'I'm about to go to a better and higher life', whereas in Socrates' case the city - since [Phaedrus] says later you're just like a visitor being shown the sights (230C7-D1), and you aren't willing to travel or leave the city - indicates that Socrates, or the wise man, always clings to his own roots, or the intelligibles, and never abandons (existasthai) himself. Appropriately, Socrates, the young man's guardian, calls Phaedrus 'dear' from the outset (prooimion). After all, to the extent that hostility or disagreement over behaviour get in the way, the initiator [cannot] initiate nor the initiand be initiated. For how will anyone who has chosen to watch over (pronoein) a person elevate someone he has not felt affection for (philein)? And how will a teacher teach someone with a soul that is not suited to learning? If strife is the opposite of love (philia) and strife is the origin (arkhê) of separation, then it is reasonable that love should be [the origin] of union. But union of things that are separate may not occur unless one of them first lays hold of the other - the more active one [laying hold] of the needy one, as fire does of iron, to take a clear example. Thus, here too, Socrates, by having called Phaedrus 'dear', lays hold of him by means of this form of address in order to make him worthy of associating with him. And if there is any need to interpret (anaptussein) the name 'Phaedrus' as well (for the ancients were no worse placed with regard to these matters either) one should be aware that Phaedrus, [who was] in pursuit of phenomenal beauty (for he was a lover of the speeches of Lysias), has learned about the truly real (15) and higher (anôterô) [kind of beauty] from Socrates. So, [by] focusing on the phenomenal, he unawares lit upon the veiled and intelligible, i.e. hidden and difficult to discern (dioran) (this is what [the name] 'Phaedrus' indicates), and moved from [one kind of] beauty to [another kind of] beauty, so as to be the type of the person who will learn about the beauty that is known by [Socrates]. From this we also learn something else: that because we have a drive (hormê) towards the good, an eagerness, a desire [for it], even though we often go wrong on account of appearance (to phainomenon), nevertheless, in [the business of] learning about reality (to on), we are not badly placed with regard to it because our soul already possesses it, even if it was mistaken about the matter (pragma) [in question]. After all, if Phaedrus had not desired beauty, he would not have learned about beauty. [The phrase where to and where from] may seem back to front. There being six kinds of motion, where from [and] where to specify local motion (phora). Now, where from comes first, while where to follows (epagesthai). But one could say (1) from a logical perspective that while motion has where from as its commencement and where to as its termination, the intention of the person who moves has where to as a kind of commencement as it were. After all, unless some other inborn desire is going to move that person to that [destination] he would not start out from where [he is] (enteuthen). [And this is so] not only in the case of living things but even in the case of natural [processes], for we call the movement towards health (hugeia) 'getting well' (hugiansis) and that towards sickness (nosos) 'sickening' (nosansis) because the movements are named from their destinations (telos). And (2) from the ethical point of view [one could say] that Socrates has regard for Phaedrus and says in effect: 'Where are you going? Where have you come from? Y ou've abandoned true beauty, the beauty in divine things, and are marvelling at the beauty in speeches. Look what you've come down to and then you'll recognise where you've come from. For, just as in the case of, let us say, roads and other places (topos), we don't seek out the earlier ones unless we come to the realisation that the later ones are more difficult, in the same way here too, Phaedrus, you cannot learn what you've been snatched away from unless you recognise how far and where you have been taken along (sunelaunein). For your present wrong turning (diamartia), being recent, is capable of carrying [you] back (anagein), by a sort of retrogression, to the condition that truly befits the soul.' And one can also say (3) from the physical perspective (phusikôs) that the second efficient cause after the Demiurge, [i.e.] nature (phusis) (it goes without saying that the divine is the demiurge of nature (16) itself as well [as of everything else]), [when] forming everything from matter, does not first ask what origins matter has had and from what motions [it has originated], but for what purpose it has been endowed with (ekhein) suitability. It is when it is assessed on that basis - according to its rational principles (logos) and formative numbers - that the product is brought to completion. For what if the seed is from good origins and sources (genesis) but isn't itself viable for the [intended] purpose, being faulty in some way? Since, then, Socrates has the status of efficient [cause] and Phaedrus [that] of material [cause], [Socrates] has with reason first investigated [Phaedrus'] fitness for his purpose so that he won't be labouring in vain in the event that there is some obstacle. But he does also pose the question where from [as his] next [priority] (deuterôs). For this too is no small matter. After all a vine could never grow from an olive pit or a bay tree from a grape seed, but each of them grows from its own beginnings (arkhê) in accordance with the law (logos) of nature. Having been asked a two-part question the young man has also given a two-part answer. However, on the surface (to phainomenon) he has, in Homeric style, given [his answer] chiastically for clarity's sake, for he has dealt with the 'where from' first, in the manner of [Homer's] 'screams of pain and shouts of triumph, from killers and killed', whereas the [deeper] meaning is that reason also knows that that second [answer], i.e. 'where he is going', is more essential. In any case, it has been dealt with (diatêrein) later so that he can quietly introduce (hupanoigein) the topics (logos) for their conversation. This is also characteristic of speechwriters, but more so of writers of dialogues and of Plato himself. Or, alternatively: Since the where from has the status of matter and the where to that of form, by adding the where to to the where from he has shown that form brings together and defines matter. And Socrates, because he is exalted and philosophical, has first sought the where to, as being form, while Phaedrus, who is uninitiated (atelês) and still preoccupied with oratory, which makes use of the matters of particular things, has given preference to the where from, as being matter. I am going (227A2): Answers are found to be pretty much (tis) of three kinds. One kind is necessary, one helpful (philanthrôpos), one redundant. For example, [in reply to] 'Where is Dion?, 'He's not here' is the necessary [answer], 'He's not here. He's in the school', the helpful one, 'He's not here. He's in the school to do this or that', the redundant one. In this case, then, where from has received a merely necessary reply, (17) where to one that is also helpful, since he adds for a walk (that is to say, 'walking'; the language is elevated in that it employs a noun (onomastikos), Phaedrus being as it were elevated by [the use of] 'walk', since it is appropriate to a man who has chosen to be sound in both body and mind.) He [sc. Plato] has rejected the redundant [reply] because he [sc. Phaedrus] was not to incur a charge (graphesthai) of garrulity when replying to Socrates. Besides, by this (enteuthen) he is also paving the way for their conversation (sunousia), for the walk is a necessity for their exchange (homilia) [to occur] and a pleasant [interlude] (kharieis), the word [sc. 'walk'] indicating that there is also the need of our choice with regard to beautiful things (ta kala) for the power that produces beauty (kallopoios) to be activated to our benefit. And besides, he has left the from where without a [stated] cause, but sets out the cause of the where to; for since the where to is the goal (telos) of motion in place and the goal is that for the sake of which [something is done], in order that the motion should not seem to be aimless, he sets out the final (telikos) cause. After all, any cause is [a cause] of coming into being rather than of passing away (apoginesthai), and because of this he has left the from where without a [stated] cause, having both intimated the cause of [Phaedrus'] having come to be with Lysias there (kakeise), and thence (kanteuthen) simultaneously also intimated that of his leaving (apoginesthai). For by saying from Lysias, of Cephalus (that is to say, 'son of', for that is the meaning in Attic even without the article) and [thereby] introducing the orator, he has shown both [that] he came to him for the sake of rhetorical instruction and [that] he left him for the sake of relaxation.`,

      comment: `'I spent a long time' and 'sitting' indicate that dallying (strophê) among material things and spending time on phenomenal beauty is onerous and irksome. And sitting also shows that the contemplation of the latter is neither lofty nor uplifting but low and hollow (koiloteros) and base, and that it pulls and drags [one] down from a better life, as does Socrates' being seated in the Phaedo.`,
