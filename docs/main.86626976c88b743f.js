Yet now, observe what that means."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["I do observe it, Ion, and I am going to point out to you what I take it to mean. For, as I was saying just now, this is not an art in you, whereby you speak well on Homer, but a divine power, which moves you like that in the stone which Euripides named a magnet,! but most people call \u2018\u201c Heraclea stone.\u201d For this stone not only attracts iron rings, but also imparts to them a power whereby they in turn are able to do the very same thing as the stone, and attract other rings; so that sometimes there is formed quite a long chain of bits of iron and rings, suspended one from another; and they all depend for this power on that one stone. In the same manner also the Muse inspires men herself, and then by means of these inspired persons the inspiration spreads to others, and holds them in a connected chain. For all the good epic poets utter all those fine poems not from art, but as inspired and possessed, and the good lyric poets likewise; just as the Corybantian? worshippers do not dance when in their senses, so the lyric poets do not indite those fine songs in their senses, but when they have started on the melody and rhythm they begin to be frantic, and it is under possession\u2014as the bacchants are possessed, and not in their senses, when they draw honey and milk from the rivers\u2014that the soul of the lyric poets does the same thing, by their own report. For the poets tell us, I believe, that the songs they bring us are the sweets they cull from honey-dropping founts in certain gardens and glades of the Muses\u2014 like the bees, and winging the air as these dot. And what they tell is true. For a poet is a light and winged and sacred thing, and is unable ever to indite until he has been inspired and put out of his senses, and his mind is no longer in him: every man, whilst he retains possession of that, is powerless to indite a verse or chant an oracle. Seeing then that it is not by art that they compose and utter so many fine things about the deeds of men\u2014as you do about Homer\u2014but by a divine dispensation, each is able only to compose that to which the Muse has stirred him, this man dithyrambs, another laudatory odes, another dance-songs, another epic or else iambic verse; but each is at fault in any other kind. For not by art do they utter these things, but by divine influence; since, if they had fully learnt by art to speak on one kind of theme, they would know how to speak on all. And for this reason God takes away the mind of these men and uses them as his ministers, just as he does soothsayers and godly seers, in order that we who hear them may know that it is not they who utter these words of great price, when they are out of their wits, but that it is God himself who speaks and addresses us through them. A convincing proof of what I say is the case of Tynnichus,? the Chalcidian, who had never composed a single poem in his life that could deserve any mention, and then produced the paean*\xae which is in everyone's mouth, almost the finest song we have, simply\u2014as he says himself\u2014* an invention of the Muses.\u201d For the god, as it seems to me, intended him to be a sign to us that we should not waver or doubt that these fine poems are not human or the work of men, but divine and the work of gods; and that the poets are merely the interpreters of the gods, according as each is possessed by one of the heavenly powers. To show this forth, the god of set purpose sang the finest of songs through the meanest of poets: or do you not think my statement true, Ion?"]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["Yes, upon my word, I do: for you somehow touch my soul with your words, Socrates, and I believe it is by divine dispensation that good poets interpret to us these utterances of the gods."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["And you rhapsodes, for your part, interpret the utterances of the poets?"]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["Again your words are true."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["And so you act as interpreters of interpreters?"]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["Precisely."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Stop now and tell me, Ion, without reserve what I may choose to ask you: when you give a good recitation and specially thrill your audience, either with the lay of Odysseus leaping forth on to the threshold, revealing himself to the suitors and pouring out the arrows before his feet, or of Achilles dashing at Hector, or some part of the sad story of Andromache or of Hecuba, or of Priam, are you then in your senses, or are you carried out of yourself, and does your soul in an ecstasy suppose herself to be among the scenes you are describing, whether they be in Ithaca, or in Troy, or as the poems may chance to place them?"]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["How vivid to me, Socrates, is this part of your proof! For I will tell you without reserve : when I relate a tale of woe, my eyes are filled with tears; and when it is of fear or awe, my hair stands on end with terror, and my heart leaps."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Well now, are we to say, Ion, that such a person is in his senses at that moment,\u2014when in all the adornment of elegant attire and golden crowns he weeps at sacrifice or festival, having been despoiled of none of his finery; or shows fear as he stands before more than twenty thousand friendly people, none of whom is stripping or injuring him?"]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["No, on my word, not at all, Socrates, to tell the strict truth."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["And are you aware that you rhapsodes produce these same effects on most of the spectators also?"]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["Yes, very fully aware: for I look down upon them from the platform and see them at such moments crying and turning awestruck eyes upon me and yielding to the amazement of my tale. For I have to pay the closest attention to them; since, if I set them crying, I shall laugh myself because of the money I take, but if they laugh, I myself shall cry because of the money I lose."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["And are you aware that your spectator is the last of the rings which I spoke of as receiving from each other the power transmitted from the Heraclean lodestone? You, the rhapsode and actor, are the middle ring; the poet himself is the first; but it is the god who through the whole series draws the souls of men whithersoever he pleases, making the power of one depend on the other. And, just as from the magnet, there is a mighty chain of choric performers and masters and under-masters suspended by side-connexions from the rings that hang down from the Muse. One poet is suspended from one Muse, another from another: the word we use for it is \u201c possessed,\u201d but it is much the same thing, for he is held. And from these first rings\u2014the poets\u2014 are suspended various others, which are thus inspired, some by Orpheus and others by Musaeus !; but the majority are possessed and held by Homer. Of whom you, Ion, are one, and are possessed by Homer; and so, when anyone recites the work of another poet, you go to sleep and are at a loss what to say; but when some one utters a strain of your poet, you wake up at once, and your soul dances, and you have plenty to say: for it is not by art or knowledge about Homer that you say what you say, but by divine dispensation and possession; just as the Corybantian worshippers are keenly sensible of that strain alone which belongs to the god whose possession is on them, and have plenty of gestures and phrases for that tune, but do not heed any other. And so you, Ion, when the subject of Homer is mentioned, have plenty to say, but nothing on any of the others. And when you ask me the reason why you can speak at large on Homer but not on the rest, I tell you it is because your skill in praising Homer comes not by art, but by divine dispensation."]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["Well spoken, I grant you, Socrates : but still I shall be surprised if you can speak well enough to convince me that I am possessed and mad when I praise Homer. Nor can I think you would believe it of me yourself, if you heard me speaking about him."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["I declare I am quite willing to hear you, but not until you have first answered me this : on what thing in Homer's story do you speak well? Not on all of them, I presume."]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["I assure you, Socrates, on all without a single exception."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Not, of course, including those things of which you have in fact no knowledge, but which Homer tells."]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["And what sort of things are they, which Homer tells, but of which I have no knowledge?"]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Why, does not Homer speak a good deal about arts, in a good many places? For instance, about chariot-driving : if I can recall the lines, I will quote them to you."]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["No, I will recite them, for I can remember."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Tell me then what Nestor says to his son Antilochus, advising him to be careful about the turning-post in the horse-race in honour of Patroclus."]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["Bend thyself in the polished car slightly to the left of them; and call to the right-hand horse and goad him on, while your hand slackens his reins.

But this I know about myself: I speak about Homer more beautifully than anybody else and I have lots to say; and everybody says I do it well. But about the other poets I do not. Now see what that means."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["I do see, Ion, and I\u2019m going to announce to you what I think that is. As I said earlier, that\u2019s not a subject you\u2019ve mastered\u2014speaking well about Homer; it\u2019s a divine power that moves you, as a \u201cMagnetic\u201d stone moves iron rings. (That\u2019s what Euripides called it; most people call it \u201cHeraclean.\u201d)2 This stone not only pulls those rings, if they\u2019re iron, it also puts power in the rings, so that they in turn can do just what the stone does\u2014pull other rings\u2014so that there\u2019s sometimes a very long chain of iron pieces and rings hanging from one another. And the power in all of them depends on this stone. In the same way, the Muse makes some people inspired herself, and then through those who are inspired a chain of other enthusiasts is suspended. You know, none of the epic poets, if they\u2019re good, are masters of their subject; they are inspired, possessed, and that is how they utter all those beautiful poems. The same goes for lyric poets if they\u2019re good: just as the Corybantes are not in their right minds when they dance, lyric poets, too, are not in their right minds when they make those beautiful lyrics, but as soon as they sail into harmony and rhythm they are possessed by Bacchic frenzy. Just as Bacchus worshippers when they are possessed draw honey and milk from rivers, but not when they are in their right minds\u2014the soul of a lyric poet does this too, as they say themselves. For of course poets tell us that they gather songs at honey-flowing springs, from glades and gardens of the Muses, and that they bear songs to us as bees carry honey, flying like bees. And what they say is true. For a poet is an airy thing, winged and holy, and he is not able to make poetry until he becomes inspired and goes out of his mind and his intellect is no longer in him. As long as a human being has his intellect in his possession he will always lack the power to make poetry or sing prophecy. Therefore because it\u2019s not by mastery that they make poems or say many lovely things about their subjects (as you do about Homer)\u2014but because it\u2019s by a divine gift\u2014each poet is able to compose beautifully only that for which the Muse has aroused him: one can do dithyrambs, another encomia, one can do dance songs, another, epics, and yet another, iambics; and each of them is worthless for the other types of poetry. You see, it\u2019s not mastery that enables them to speak those verses, but a divine power, since if they knew how to speak beautifully on one type of poetry by mastering the subject, they could do so for all the others also. That\u2019s why the god takes their intellect away from them when he uses them as his servants, as he does prophets and godly diviners, so that we who hear should know that they are not the ones who speak those verses that are of such high value, for their intellect is not in them: the god himself is the one who speaks, and he gives voice through them to us. The best evidence for this account is Tynnichus from Chalcis, who never made a poem anyone would think worth mentioning, except for the praise-song everyone sings, almost the most beautiful lyric-poem there is, and simply, as he says himself, \u201can invention of the Muses.\u201d In this more than anything, then, I think, the god is showing us, so that we should be in no doubt about it, that these beautiful poems are not human, not even from human beings, but are divine and from gods; that poets are nothing but representatives of the gods, possessed by whoever possesses them. To show that, the god deliberately sang the most beautiful lyric poem through the most worthless poet. Don\u2019t you think I\u2019m right, Ion?"]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["Lord yes, I certainly do. Somehow you touch my soul with your words, Socrates, and I do think it\u2019s by a divine gift that good poets are able to present these poems to us from the gods."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["And you rhapsodes in turn present what the poets say."]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["That\u2019s true too."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["So you turn out to be representatives of representatives."]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["Quite right."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Hold on, Ion; tell me this.

You see I must keep my wits and pay close attention to them: if I start them crying, I will laugh as I take their money, but if they laugh, I shall cry at having lost money."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["And you know that this spectator is the last of the rings, don\u2019t you\u2014the ones that I said take their power from each other by virtue of the Heraclean stone [the magnet]? The middle ring is you, the rhapsode or actor, and the first one is the poet himself. The god pulls people\u2019s souls through all these wherever he wants, looping the power down from one to another. And just as if it hung from that stone, there\u2019s an enormous chain of choral dancers and dance teachers and assistant teachers hanging off to the sides of the rings that are suspended from the Muse. One poet is attached to one Muse, another to another (we say he is \u201cpossessed,\u201d and that\u2019s near enough, for he is held). From these first rings, from the poets, they are attached in their turn and inspired, some from one poet, some from another: some from Orpheus, some from Musaeus, and many are possessed and held from Homer. You are one of them, Ion, and you are possessed from Homer. And when anyone sings the work of another poet, you\u2019re asleep and you\u2019re lost about what to say; but when any song of that poet is sounded, you are immediately awake, your soul is dancing, and you have plenty to say. You see it\u2019s not because you\u2019re a master of knowledge about Homer that you can say what you say, but because of a divine gift, because you are possessed. That\u2019s how it is with the Corybantes, who have sharp ears only for the specific song that belongs to whatever god possesses them; they have plenty of words and movements to go with that song; but they are quite lost if the music is different. That\u2019s how it is with you, Ion: when anyone mentions Homer, you have plenty to say, but if he mentions the others you are lost; and the explanation of this, for which you ask me\u2014why it is that you have plenty to say about Homer but not about the others\u2014is that it\u2019s not mastering the subject, but a divine gift, that makes you a wonderful singer of Homer\u2019s praises."]},{character:r.Ion,speech:["You\u2019re a good speaker, Socrates.

requesting you to come and see it with us.","However, we will tell you now; for we think we should speak our minds freely to friends like you.","Some people, of course, pour ridicule on such appeals, and when consulted for their advice will not say what they think, but something different, making the inquirer's wishes their aim, and speaking against their own judgement.","But you, we consider, not merely have the necessary discernment but will give us the benefit of it in telling us just what is in your minds;","and hence we have enlisted your counsel on the question which we are about to lay before you.","Now the matter about which I have made all this long preamble is this: we have two sons here,","my friend that one, called Thucydides after his grandfather,","and I this one; he also is named in the same way, after my father; we call him Aristeides.","Well, we have resolved to give them our most constant care, and not\u2014as most fathers do when their boys begin to be young men -let them run loose as their fancy leads them,","but begin forthwith taking every possible care of them.","Now, knowing that you too have sons, we thought that you above all men must have concerned

long.","My friend Melesias and I take our meals together, and our boys share our table.","Now, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are going to speak quite freely to you.","Each of us has many noble deeds of his own father to relate to these young fellows \u2014 their numerous achievements both in war and in peace,","when they were managing the affairs either of the allies or of this city;","but neither of us has any deeds of his own to tell.","We cannot help feeling ashamed that our boys should observe this, and we blame our fathers for leaving us to indulge ourselves when we

our advice they will win no reputation,","but if they take due pains they may very likely come to be worthy of the names they bear.","Now they, for their part, say they will do as we bid;","so we are

ourselves, and to take you along with us not merely as companions at the show, but also as counsellors and co-partners, if you will be so good, in the matter of looking after our sons.","That is the

Come, Nicias, let one or other of you speak."]},{character:r.Nicias,speech:["There is no difficulty about that, Socrates.","For in my opinion this accomplishment is in many ways a useful thing for young men to possess.","It is good for them, instead of spending their time on the ordinary things to which young men usually give their hours of leisure, to spend it on this,","which not only has the necessary effect of improving their bodily health\u2014since it is as good and strenuous as any physical exercise\u2014but","is also a form of exercise which, with riding, is particularly fitting for a free citizen ;","for only the men trained in the use of these warlike implements can claim to be trained in the contest whereof we are athletes and in the affairs wherein we are called upon to contend.","Further, this accomplishment will be of some benefit also in actual battle, when it comes to fighting in line with a number of other men ;","but its greatest advantage will be felt when the ranks are broken, and you find you must fight man to man,","either in pursuing someone who is trying to beat off your attack, or in retreating yourself and beating off the attack of another.","Whoever possessed this accomplishment could come to no harm so long as he had but one to deal with, nor yet, perhaps, if he had several ; it would give him an advantage in any situation.","Moreover, it is a thing which impels one to desire another noble accomplishment ;","for everyone who has learnt how to fight in armour will desire to learn the accomplishment which comes next, the management of troops ;","and when he has got that and once taken a pride in his work he will push on to attain the whole art of generalship.","It is evident already that all accomplishments and pursuits in the military sphere are both honorable and valuable to a man, either in acquisition or in practice ; and this particular one may well be an introduction to them.","And we can make this addition\u2014no slight one\u2014to its claims, that this science will make any man individually a great deal bolder and braver in war.","Nor let us disdain to mention, even though some may think it a rather slight matter,","that it will give him a smarter appearance in the place where a man should look smartest,","and where at the same time he will appear more terrible to the enemy because of his smartness.","So my opinion is, Lysimachus, as I say, that we ought to teach this skill to our young men, and I have told you my reasons for so thinking.","But if Laches has a different view to state, I shall be as glad as anyone to hear it."]},{character:r.Laches,speech:["Well, Nicias, I am loth to say of any sort of accomplishment that it ought not to be learnt ;","for it seems good to know all things.","And besides, if this skill in arms is an accomplishment, as they say who teach it, and as Nicias terms it, it ought to be learnt ;","while if it is not an accomplishment, and those who promise to give it are deceiving us,","or if it is an accomplishment, but not a very important one, what can be the good of learning it?","I speak of it in this way from the following point of view :","I conceive that if there were anything in it, it would not have been overlooked by the Lacedaemonians,","whose only concern in life is to seek out and practice whatever study or pursuit will give them an advantage over others in war.","And if they have overlooked it, at any rate these teachers of it cannot have overlooked the obvious fact that the Lacedaemonians are more intent on such matters than any of the Greeks,","and that anybody who won honour among them for this art would amass great riches elsewhere, just as a tragic poet does who has won honour among us.","And for this reason he who thinks himself a good writer of tragedy does not tour round with his show in a circuit of the outlying Attic towns,","but makes a straight line for this place and exhibits to our people, as one might expect.","But I notice that these fighters in armour regard Lacedaemon as holy ground where none may tread, and do not step on it even with the tips of their toes,","but circle round it and prefer to exhibit to any other people,","especially to those who would themselves admit that they were inferior to many in the arts of war.","Furthermore, Lysimachus, I have come across more than a few of these persons in actual operations, and I can see their quality.","Indeed, we can estimate it offhand : for, as though it were of set purpose, not one of these experts in arms has ever yet distinguished himself in war.","And yet in all the other arts, the men who have made a name are to be found among those who have specially pursued one or other of them ;","while these persons, apparently, stand out from the rest in this particularly hapless fate of their profession.","Why, this man Stesilaus, whom you watched with me in that great crowd as he gave his performance and spoke in those high terms of himself before us,","I have watched elsewhere giving a finer entertainment in the form of a very real display that he made against his will.","The ship on which he was serving struck a transport vessel,","and he was using in the fight a combination of a scythe and a spear\u2014a remarkable weapon that suited so remarkable a man.","Well, the story of this fellow's doings is hardly of enough interest in the main,","but you must hear the upshot of his device of a scythe fixed to a spear.","As he was fighting, it stuck somehow in the other ship's rigging, and held fast ;","so Stesilaus pulled at it in the hope of getting it free, but he could not, and the ships were passing by each other.","For the first moments he ran along in his ship holding on to his spear ;","but as the other ship sheered off from his and drew him after,","still holding the spear, he let it slip through his hand until he gripped the butt-end of the shaft.","From the crew of the transport there came laughter and clapping at his posture,","and when someone aimed a stone at him which hit the deck near his feet, and he let go the spear,","the troops on the warship in their turn could no longer restrain their laughter, as they saw the notable scythe-spear dangling from the transport.","Now, there may perhaps be something in this art of theirs, as Nicias argues,","but at any rate that is my impression of it, in the cases I have met with.","Hence, as I said at the beginning, whether it be an accomplishment, and one of but little use,","or not an accomplishment, but only supposed and pretended to be such, it is not worth the trouble of learning it.","For indeed I hold that if a man who was a coward believed that he possessed it, his only gain would be in rashness,","which would make his true nature the more conspicuous ;","while if he were brave, people would be on the look-out for even the slightest mistake on his part, and he would incur much grievous slander ;","for the pretension to such skill arouses jealousy,","so that unless a man be prodigiously superior to the rest in valour he cannot by any means escape being made a laughing-stock through professing to be so skilled.","Such is my opinion, Lysimachus, of the interest taken in this accomplishment ;","but do as I told you at the beginning ; you are not to let our friend Socrates go,","but must request him to advise us according to his judgement on the matter in hand."]},{character:r.Lysimachus,speech:["Well, I ask it of you, Socrates :","for indeed our members of council, as

Now I am accustomed to him, and so I know that one is bound to be thus treated by him, and further, that I myself shall certainly get the same treatment also. For I dehght, Lysimachus, in conversing with the man, and see no harm in our being reminded of any past or present misdoing : nay, one must needs take more careful thought for the rest of one's life, if one does not fly from his words but is mlUng, as Solon said,^ and zealous to learn as long as one hves, \u2022and does not expect to get good sense by the mere arrival of old age. So to me there is nothing unusual, or unpleasant either, in being tried and tested by Socrates ; in fact, I knew pretty well all the time that our argument would not be about the boys if Socrates were present, but about ourselves.

For you might think me a lover, and yet also a hater, of discussions : for when I hear a man discussing virtue or any kind of wisdom, one who is truly a man and worthy of his argument, I am exceedingly delighted ; I take the speaker and his speech together, and observe how they sort and harmonize with each other. Such a man is exactly what I understand by " musical,"\u2014he has tuned himself with the fairest harmony, not that of a lyre or other entertaining instrument, but has made a true concord of his own life between his words and his deeds, not in the Ionian, no, nor in the Phrygian nor in the Lydian, but simply in the Dorian mode,- which is the sole Hellenic harmony. Such a man makes me rejoice with his utterance, and anyone would judge me then a lover of discussion, so eagerly do I take in what he says : but a man who shows the opposite character gives me pain, and the better he seems to speak, the more I am pained, with the result, in this case, that I am judged a hater of discussion. Now of Socrates\' words I have no experience, but formerly, I fancy, I have made trial of his deeds ; and there I found him hving up to any fine words however freely spoken. So if he has that gift as well, his wish is mine, and I should be very glad to be cross-examined by such a man, and should not chafe at learning ; but I too agree %vith Solon, while adding just one word to his saying : I should like, as I. grow old, to learn more and more, but only from honest folk. Let him concede to me that my teacher is himself good\u2014else I shall disUke my lessons and be judged a dunce\u2014but if you say that my teacher is to be a younger man, or one who so far has no reputation, or anything of that sort, I care not a jot. I therefore invite you, Socrates, both to teach and to refute me as much as you please, and to learn too what I on my part know ; such is the position you hold in my eyes since that day on which you came through the same danger with me,^ and gave a proof of your own valour which is to be expected of anyone who hopes to justify his good name.

So take my place in inquiring on behalf of the young men ; make out what it is that we want our friends here to tell us, and be our adviser by discussing it with them. For I find that owing to my age I forget the questions I intend to put, and also the answers I receive ; and if the discussion changes in the middle, my memory goes altogether.

What other persons have we made better?" \u2014 are perhaps of a kind on which we might well examine ourselves : but I believe this other way of inquiring leads to the same thing, and will probably also start more from the beginning. For if we happen to know of such and such a thing that by being joined to another thing it makes this thing better, and further, if we are able to get the one joined to the other, we obviously know the thing itself on which we might be consulting as to how it might be best and most easily acquired. Now I daresay you do not grasp my meaning. Well, you will grasp it more easily in this way. If we happen to know that sight joined to eyes makes those eyes the better for it, and further if we are able to get it joined to eyes, we obviously know what this faculty of sight is, on which we might be consulting as to how it might be best and most easily acquired.

not?"]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Why, I'll try to give the best advice I can, Lysimachus, and to do all you ask.","But since I'm younger than these gentlemen (Socrates indicates Nicias and Laches) and less experienced, I think it very right for me first to hear what they have to say and to learn from them. If I have anything to add, I'll at that point teach and persuade both you and them. But Nicias, why doesn't one of you begin?"]},{character:r.Nicias,speech:["Nothing prevents it, Socrates.","Indeed, I think this study is beneficial to young men in many ways.","For one thing, it's good for them not to spend time elsewhere on the things young men like when they're at leisure, but on this instead;","the body necessarily improves from it, for it's in no way inferior to other bodily exercise, or less strenuous.","And at the same time this exercise and horsemanship especially befit a free man.","For we are athletes in a contest, and in the matters in which we contend, only those are exercised who are exercised in the tools of war.","Then too, this study will also be a benefit in combat when one might fight in ranks with many others,","but its greatest benefit is when ranks are broken and single combat is required,","either pursuing someone warding off attack or warding off attack when retreating oneself.","A man who knew this would not suffer at the hands of a single opponent, and perhaps not even of many, but everywhere gain the advantage.","Again, this sort of thing calls forth desire for another excellent study:","anyone who learns to fight in armor would want to go on next to the study of tactics, the ordering of men in ranks,","and once he grasps this and his ambition is stirred, he'll be eager for all that pertains to strategy, the art of the general.","It's already clear that every study and practice involved in these subjects is noble and of great value for a man to study and practice, for which this study might serve as introduction.","I'll add-and it's no small addition-that this knowledge would make any man more confident and courageous in war, and by no small amount.","Nor let us disdain to say, even if one thinks it less important,","that it will also make him more graceful where a man should appear more graceful,","and in a place where at the same time he will appear more terrible to his enemies by reason of his gracefulness.","So for my part, Lysimachus, as I say, I think it should be taught to the lads, and I've said why I think so.","But if Laches has something contrary to say, I'd myself gladly listen."]},{character:r.Laches,speech:["Why Nicias, it's hard to say of any study whatever that it shouldn't be learned,","because it seems good to know everything,","and in particular this skill in arms, if it's really the subject of study its teachers claim and Nicias says;","but if it's not a subject of study and those who profess it are practicing a deception,","or if it is a subject of study but not a very serious one, why learn it?","I say this with a view to the following:","I think if it amounted to anything, the Spartans would not have ignored it;","nothing else matters in life to them except to seek and practice whatever once learned and practiced gives them advantage over others in war.","If they've ignored it, that very fact is something at least these teachers of it have not ignored, namely, that the Spartans are in earnest about this sort of thing beyond all other Greeks,","and that anyone honored by them in it would make much more money from the rest, as tragic poets do when honored by us.","That's why anybody who thinks he's good at producing tragedy doesn't go on circuit outside the walls, putting on performances in other cities around Attica,","but brings his work straight here and performs for this audience-reasonably enough.","But, I see, these people who fight in armor believe Sparta is sacred and forbidden ground, not to be trod on even tip-toe;","they skirt it and put on a show for everyone else instead,","especially those who'd even themselves agree they have many superiors in warfare.","Then again, Lysimachus, I've met quite a few of these fellows in the work itself, and I see what they are.","Indeed, we can look at it from that point of view: for as though to illustrate the point, not one of these experts in armor-fighting has ever yet become distinguished in war.","And yet those who get a name for anything else do so from the practice of it.","It seems these folk, compared to others, have in this respect been quite remarkably unfortunate.","For instance, take this fellow Stesilaus, whom you and I watched putting on a show in that great crowd and boasting about himself.","I watched him elsewhere under real conditions put on a better show-though not voluntarily.","The warship he was serving on rammed a merchantman,","and he was fighting with a sicklespear-another kind of weapon for another kind of fellow.","Well, the rest of the story is hardly worth telling,","except for the bit of cleverness about the sickle attached to the spear and what resulted.","As he was fighting, it caught somewhere in the tackle of the merchantman and got stuck.","So Stesilaus pulled, trying to free it, but he couldn't-and ship was passing ship.","So he ran along the side for a while hanging onto his spear,","but when ship sheared off from ship and drew him with it,","still hanging onto his spear, the spear pulled through his hand until all he had hold of was the end of the shaft.","There was laughter and applause from the crew of the merchantman at the figure he made,","and when somebody threw a stone at the deck by his feet he let go of the spear,","and at that point even the crew of his own trireme could no longer contain their laughter at seeing that sickle-spear dangling from the rigging.","Well, maybe there's something in this, as Nicias says,","but my own experience of it has been things like this.","So as I said to begin with, it's not worth trying to learn whether it's a study of small usefulness,","or whether they claim and pretend it's a subject of study when it isn't.","In fact, I think if a coward supposed he knew it, he'd only become more rash because of it,","and his cowardice would become even more evident;","but if he were courageous, people would be on guard against him, and if he made even a little mistake, he'd incur great prejudice.","For pretensions to such knowledge rouse jealousy,","so that unless one is astonishingly superior in virtue to the rest, it's impossible to escape becoming a laughingstock by claiming to have this knowledge.","So that's about what I think of taking this study seriously, Lysimachus.","But as I told you to begin with, don't let Socrates here go,","but ask him to advise us what he thinks about the subject before us."]},{character:r.Lysimachus,speech:["Why, I do ask it, Socrates.","In fact I think our council needs a

Once he is entangled, Socrates will not let him go until Socrates has well and thoroughly put all his ways to the test. I'm used to the fellow, and I know what must be suffered at his hands-yes, and still further, I well know I'll suffer it myself. I delight in being near the man, Lysimachus; I think there's nothing bad in being reminded of what I'm not doing or haven't done well. On the contrary, a man necessarily lives the rest of his life with more forethought if he doesn't avoid this but is willing, as Solon says, to continue learning as long as he lives,\" and doesn't assume that old age by itself brings intelligence. For me, there's nothing unaccustomed or unpleasant in being put to the test by Socrates; indeed, I pretty well knew awhile ago that with Socrates present the discussion would not be about the young men but about ourselves.

Actually, I'd seem to some to love argument and also to hate it. For when I hear a man discussing virtue or any kind of wisdom, if he's genuinely a man and worthy of the words he speaks, I am exceedingly delighted, because I look at once to the speaker and what he says to see that they fit each other and are in accord. A man like that seems to me entirely musical: he has not brought into most noble attunement a lyre or an instrument of entertainment, but really brought into attunement his own life, a concord of words fitted to deeds quite in the Dorian mode\u2014the only mode which is solely Greek, as distinct from the Ionian or Phrygian or Lydian. Well, a man like that makes me delight in his utterance, makes me seem to everyone to be a lover of argument\u2014so eagerly do I accept what he says. But someone who does the opposite of this pains me, the more by so much as he seems to speak better, and he on the other hand makes me seem to hate argument. I have no experience of the arguments of Socrates, but before this I put his deeds to the test, I think, and there found him worthy of noble words and all frankness of speech. So if he has that too, I'm of one mind with the man; I'd be very pleased to be examined by such a person, and I wouldn't be distressed at learning. For I agree with Solon too, with only one addition. I'm willing as I grow older to be taught many things, but only by good men. Grant that my teacher is himself good, so that I may not appear hard to teach and displeased at learning. I don't care if the teacher is younger than I am, or not yet famous, or anything of the sort. I invite you then, Socrates, to teach and refute me however you may wish, and to learn at least what I know. I've been disposed this way toward you since that day in which we passed through peril together and you gave proof of your own virtue, which a man must give if he intends to give rightly.

Perhaps it's no bad thing to ask ourselves what we just undertook to consider, namely, who our teachers in this sort of education have been, or whom we've made better. But I suppose the following kind of inquiry bears on the same issue and is perhaps more nearly fundamental: if we happen to know of anything whatever that, being present to something, makes that to which it is present better, and if in addition we are able to make it come to be present to that thing, it is clear that we know the thing about which we might become advisors as to how one might best and most easily possess it. Perhaps you don't understand what I mean, and you'll learn more easily this way. If we know that sight, when present to eyes, makes that to which it is present better, and if in addition we're able to make it come to be present to eyes, clearly we know what sight itself is, about which we may become counselors as to how one might best and most easily possess it.

Of courage and forethought, I think, very few have a share.

So similarly again farming, concerning things which grow from the soil.

You know what my condition is, and you have heard how I think it is to our advantage to arrange these matters.","And I claim that I ought not to be refused what I ask because I am not your lover.","For lovers repent of the kindnesses they have done when their passion ceases ; but there is no time when non-lovers naturally repent.","For they do kindnesses to the best of their ability, not under compulsion, but of their free will, according to their view of their own best interest.","And besides, lovers consider the injury they have done to their own concerns on account of their love, and the benefits they have conferred, and they add the trouble they have had, and so they think they have long ago made sufficient return to the beloved ;","but non-lovers cannot aver neglect of their own affairs because of their condition, nor can they take account of the pains they have been at in the past, nor lay any blame for quarrels with their relatives ;","and so, since all these evils are removed, there is nothing left for them but to do eagerly what they think will please the beloved.","And besides, if lovers ought to be highly esteemed because they say they have the greatest love for the objects of their passion, since both by word and deed they are ready to make themselves hated by others to please the beloved, it is easy to see that,","if what they say is true, whenever they fall in love afterwards, they will care for the new love more than for the old and will certainly injure the old love, if that pleases the new.","And how can one reasonably entrust matters of such importance to one who is afflicted with a disease such that no one of any experience would even try to cure it?","For they themselves confess that they are insane, rather than in their right mind, and that they know they are foolish, but cannot control themselves ;","and so, how could they, when they have come to their senses, think those acts were good which they determined upon when in such a condition?","And if you were to choose the best from among your lovers, your choice would be limited to a few ;","whereas it would be made from a great number, if you chose the most congenial from non-lovers, so that you would have a better chance, in choosing among many, of finding the one most worthy of your affection.","Now if you are afraid of public opinion, and fear that if people find out your love affair you will be disgraced, consider that lovers, believing that others would be as envious of them as they are of others, are likely to be excited by possession and in their pride to show everybody that they have not toiled in vain ;","but the non-lovers, since they have control of their feelings, are likely to choose what is really best, rather than to court the opinion of mankind.","Moreover, many are sure to notice and see the lovers going about with their beloved ones and making that their chief business,","and so, when they are seen talking with each other, people think they are met in connection with some love-matter either past or future ;","but no one ever thinks of finding fault with non-lovers because they meet, since everyone knows that one must converse with somebody, either because of friendship or because it is pleasant for some other reason.","And then, too, if you are frightened by the thought that it is hard for friendship to last, and that under other circumstances any quarrel would be an equal misfortune to both, but that when you have surrendered what you prize most highly you would be the chief sufferer,","it would be reasonable for you to be more afraid of the lovers ; for they are pained by many things and they think everything that happens is done for the sake of hurting them.","Therefore they prevent their loves from associating with other men, for they fear the wealthy, lest their money give them an advantage, and the educated, lest they prove superior in intellect ;","and they are on their guard against the influence of everyone who possesses any other good thing.","If now they persuade you to incur the dislike of all these, they involve you in a dearth of friends, and if you consider your own interest and are more sensible than they, you will have to quarrel with them.","But those who are not in love, but who have gained the satisfaction of their desires because of their merit, would not be jealous of those who associated with you,","but would hate those who did not wish to do so, thinking that you are slighted by these last and benefited by the former, so that there is much more likelihood that they will gain friendship than enmity from their love-affair with you.","And then, too, many lovers are moved by physical passion before they know the character or have become acquainted with the connections of the beloved,","so that it is uncertain whether they will wish to be your friends after their passion has ceased.","But in the case of those who are not in love, who were your friends before entering into the closer relation, the favours received are not likely to make the friendship less, but will remain as pledges of future joys.","And then, too, it will be better for your character to yield to me than to a lover.","For lovers praise your words and acts beyond due measure, partly through fear of incurring your displeasure, and partly because their own judgment is obscured by their passion.","For such are the exhibitions of the power of Love :","he makes the unsuccessful lovers think that things are grievous which cause no pain to others, and he compels the successful to praise what ought not to give pleasure ;","therefore those whom they love are more to be pitied than envied.","But if you yield to me, I shall consort with you, not with a view to present pleasure only, but to future advantage also, not being overcome by passion but in full control of myself,","and not taking up violent enmity because of small matters, but slowly gathering little anger when the transgressions are great, forgiving involuntary wrongs and trying to prevent intentional ones;","for these are the proofs of a friendship that will endure for a long time.","But if you have a notion that friendship cannot be firm unless one is in love, you should bear in mind that in that case we should not have great affection for sons or for fathers and mothers,","nor should we possess faithful friends who have been gained not through passion but through associations of a different kind.","Besides, if you ought to grant favours to those who ask for them most eagerly, you ought in other matters also to confer benefits, not on the best, but on the most needy ; for they will be most grateful, since they are relieved of the greatest ills.","And then, too, at private entertainments you ought not to invite your friends, but beggars and those who need a meal ; for they will love you and attend you and come to your doors and be most pleased and grateful, and will call down many blessings upon your head.","Perhaps, however, you ought not to grant favours to those who beg for them, but to those who are most able to repay you ; and not to those who ask merely, but to the most deserving ;","and not to those who will enjoy your youthful beauty, but to those who will share their good things with you when you are older ; and not to those who, when they have succeeded, will boast to others of their success, but to those who will modestly keep it a secret from all ;","and not to those who will be enamoured for a little while, but to those who will be your friends for life ; and not to those who will seek a pretext for a quarrel when their passion has died out, but to those who will show their own merit when your youth is passed.","Do you, then, remember what I have said, and bear this also in mind, that lovers are admonished by their friends, who think their way of life is bad, but no relative ever blamed a non-lover for bad management of his own interests on account of that condition.","Perhaps you may ask me if I advise you to grant favours to all non-lovers.","But I think the lover would not urge you to be so disposed toward all lovers either ; for the favour, if scattered broadcast, is not so highly prized by the rational recipient, nor can you, if you wish, keep your relations with one hidden from the rest.","But from love no harm ought to come, but benefit to both parties.","Now I think I have said enough.

Now there was once upon a time a boy, or rather a stripling, of great beauty : and he had many lovers. And among these was one of peculiar craftiness, who was as much in love with the boy as anyone, but had made him believe that he was not in love ; and once in wooing him, he tried to persuade him of this very thing, that favours ought to be granted rather to the non-lover than to the lover ; and his words were as follows : There is only one way, dear boy, for those to begin who are to take counsel wisely about anything. One must know what the counsel is about, or it is sure to be utterly futile, but most people are ignorant of the fact that they do not know the nature of things. So, supposing that they do know it, they come to no agreement in the beginning of their enquiry, and as they go on they reach the natural result, they agree neither with themselves nor with each other. Now you and I must not fall into the error which we condemn in others, but, since we are to discuss the question, whether the lover or the non-lover is to be preferred let us first agree on a definition of love, its nature and its power, and then, keeping this definition in view and making constant reference to it, let us enquire whether love brings advantage or harm. Now everyone sees that love is a desire ; and we know too that non-lovers also desire the beautiful. How then are we to distinguish the lover from the non-lover? We must observe that in each one of us there are two ruling and leading principles, which we follow whithersoever they lead ; one is the innate desire for pleasures, the other an acquired opinion which strives for the best. These two sometimes agree within us and are sometimes in strife ; and sometimes one, and sometimes the other has the greater power. Now when opinion leads through reason toward the best and is more powerful, its power is called self-restraint, but when desire irrationally drags us toward pleasures and rules within us, its rule is called excess. Now excess has many names, for it has many members and many forms ; and whichever of these forms is most marked gives its own name, neither beautiful nor honourable, to him who possesses it. For example, if the desire for food prevails over the higher reason and the other desires, it is called gluttony, and he who possesses it will be called by the corresponding name of glutton, and again, if the desire for drink becomes the tyrant and leads him who possesses it toward drink, we know what he is called ; and it is quite clear what fitting names of the same sort will be given when any desire akin to these acquires the rule. The reason for what I have said hitherto is pretty clear by this time, but everything is plainer when spoken than when unspoken ; so I say that the desire which overcomes the rational opinion that strives toward the right, and which is led away toward the enjoyment of beauty and again is strongly forced by the desires that are kindred to itself toward personal beauty, when it gains the victory, takes its name from that very force, and is called love. 1 Well, my dear Phaedrus, does it seem to you, as it does to me, that I am inspired?"]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["Certainly, Socrates, you have an unusual fluency."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Then listen to me in silence ; for truly the place seems filled with a divine presence ; so do not be surprised if I often seem to be in a frenzy as my discourse progresses, for I am already almost uttering dithyrambics."]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["That is very true."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:['You are responsible for that ; but hear what follows ; for perhaps the attack may be averted. That, however, is in the hands of God ; we must return to our boy. Well then, my dearest, what the subject is, about which we are to take counsel, has been said and defined, and now let us continue, keeping our attention fixed upon that definition, and tell what advantage or harm will naturally come from the lover or the non-lover to him who grants them his favours. He who is ruled by desire and is a slave to pleasure will inevitably desire to make his beloved as pleasing to himself as possible. Now to one who is of unsound mind everything is pleasant which does not oppose him, but everything that is better or equal is hateful. So the lover will not, if he can help it, endure a beloved who is better than himself or his equal, but always makes him weaker and inferior ; but the ignorant is inferior to the wise, the coward to the brave, the poor speaker to the eloquent, the slow of wit to the clever. Such mental defects, and still greater than these, in the beloved will necessarily please the lover, if they are implanted by Nature, and if they are not, he must implant them or be deprived of his immediate enjoyment. And he is of necessity jealous and will do him great harm by keeping him from many advantageous associations, which would most tend to make a man of him, especially from that which would do most to make him wise. This is divine philosophy, and from it the lover will certainly keep his beloved away, through fear of being despised ; and he will contrive to keep him ignorant of everything else and make him look to his lover for everything, so that he will be most agreeable to him and most harmful to himself. In respect to the intellect, then, a man in love is by no means a profitable guardian or associate. We must next consider how he who is forced to follow pleasure and not good will keep the body of him whose master he is, and what care he will give to it. He will plainly court a beloved who is effeminate, not virile, not brought up in the pure sunshine, but in mingled shade, unused to manly toils and the sweat of exertion, but accustomed to a delicate and unmanly mode of life, adorned with a bright complexion of artificial origin, since he has none by nature, and in general living a life such as all this indicates, which it is certainly not worth while to describe further. We can sum it all up briefly and pass on. A person with such a body, in war and in all important crises, gives courage to his enemies, and fills his friends, and even his lovers themselves, with fear. This may be passed over as self-evident, but the next question, what advantage or harm the intercourse and guardianship of the lover will bring to his beloved in the matter of his property, must be discussed. Now it is clear to everyone, and especially to the lover, that he would desire above all things to have his beloved bereft of the dearest and kindest and holiest possessions ; for he would wish him to be deprived of father, mother, relatives and friends, thinking that they would hinder and censure his most sweet intercourse with him. But he will also think that one who has property in money or other possessions will be less easy to catch and when caught will be less manageable ; wherefore the lover must necessarily begrudge his beloved the possession of property and rejoice at its loss. Moreover the lover would wish his beloved to be as long as possible unmarried, childless, and homeless, since he wishes to enjoy as long as possible what is pleasant to himself. Now there are also other evils, but God has mingled with most of them some temporary pleasure ; so, for instance, a flatterer is a horrid creature and does great harm, yet Nature has combined with him a kind of pleasure that is not without charm, and one might find fault with a courtesan as an injurious thing, and there are many other such creatures and practices which are yet for the time being very pleasant ; but a lover is not only harmful to his beloved but extremely disagreeable to live with as well. The old proverb says, " birds of a feather flock together " ; that is, I suppose, equality of age leads them to similar pleasures and through similarity begets friendship ; and yet even they grow tired of each other\'s society. Now compulsion of every kind is said to be oppressive to every one, and the lover not only is unlike his beloved, but he exercises the strongest compulsion. For he is old while his love is young, and he does not leave him day or night, if he can help it, but is driven by the sting of necessity, which urges him on, always giving him pleasure in seeing, hearing, touching, and by aH his senses perceiving his beloved, so that he is glad to serve him constantly. But what consolation or what pleasure can he give the beloved? Must not this protracted intercourse bring him to the uttermost disgust, as he looks at the old, unlovely face, and other things to match, which it is not pleasant even to hear about, to say nothing of being constantly compelled to come into contact with them? And he is suspiciously guarded in all ways against everybody, and has to listen to untimely and exaggerated praises and to reproaches which are unendurable when the man is sober, and when he is in his cups and indulges in wearisome and unrestrained freedom of speech become not only unendurable but disgusting. And while he is in love he is harmful and disagreeable, but when his love has ceased he is thereafter false to him whom he formerly hardly induced to endure his wearisome companionship through the hope of future benefits by making promises with many prayers and oaths. But now that the time of payment has come he has a new ruler and governor within him, sense and reason in place of love and madness, and has become a different person ; but of this his beloved knows nothing. He asks of him a return for former favours, reminding him of past sayings and doings, as if he were speaking to the same man ; but the lover is ashamed to say that he has changed, and yet he cannot keep the oaths and promises he made when he was ruled by his former folly, now that he has regained his reason and come to his senses, lest by doing what he formerly did he become again what he was. He runs away from these things, and the former lover is compelled to become a defaulter. The shell has fallen with the other side up ; 1 and he changes his part and runs away ; and the other is forced to run after him in anger and with imprecations, he who did not know at the start that he ought never to have accepted a lover who was necessarily without reason, but rather a reasonable non-lover ; for otherwise he would have to surrender himself to one who was faithless, irritable, jealous, and disagreeable, harmful to his property, harmful to his physical condition, and most harmful by far to the cultivation of his soul, than which there neither is nor ever will be anything of higher importance in truth either in heaven or on earth. These things, dear boy, you must bear in mind, and you must know that the fondness of the lover is not a matter of goodwill, but of appetite which he wishes to satisfy : Just as the wolf loves the lamb, so the lover adores his beloved. There it is, Phaedrus! Do not listen to me any longer ; let my speech end here.']},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["But I thought you were in the middle of it, and would say as much about the non-lover as you have said about the lover, to set forth all his good points and show that he ought to be favoured.

Now I, my friend, must purify myself ; and for those who have sinned in matters of mythology there is an ancient purification, unknown to Homer, but known to Stesichoms. For when he was stricken with blindness for speaking ill of Helen, he was not, like Homer, ignorant of the reason, but since he was educated, he knew it and straightway he writes the poem: " That saying is not true ; thou didst not go within the well-oared ships, nor didst thou come to the walls of Troy " ; l and when he had written all the poem, which is called the recantation, he saw again at once.

And I must say that this saying is not true, which teaches that when a lover is at hand the non-lover should be more favoured, because the lover is insane, and the other sane. For if it were a simple fact that insanity is an evil, the saying would be true ; but in reality the greatest of blessings come to us through madness, when it is sent as a gift of the gods. For the prophetess at Delphi and the priestesses at Dodona when they have been mad have conferred many splendid benefits upon Greece both in private and in public affairs, but few or none when they have been in their right minds ; and if we should speak of the Sibyl and all the others who by prophetic inspiration have foretold many things to many persons and thereby made them fortunate afterwards, anyone can see that we should speak a long time. And it is worth while to adduce also the fact that those men of old who invented names thought that madness was neither shameful nor disgraceful ; otherwise they would not have connected the very word mania with the noblest of arts, that which foretells the future, by calling it the manic art. No, they gave this name thinking that mania, when it comes by gift of the gods, is a noble thing, but nowadays people call prophecy the mantic art, tastelessly inserting a T in the word. So also, when they gave a name to the investigation of the future which rational persons conduct through observation of birds and by other signs, since they furnish mind (nous) and information (historia) to human thought (oiesis) from the intellect (dianoia) they called it the oionoistic (oionoistike) art, which modern folk now call oionistic, making it more high-sounding by introducing the long O. The ancients, then testify that in proportion as prophecy (mantike) is superior to augury, both in name and in fact, in the same proportion madness, which comes from god, is superior to sanity, which is of human origin. Moreover, when diseases and the greatest troubles have been visited upon certain families through some ancient guilt, madness has entered in and by oracular power has found a way of release for those in need, taking refuge in prayers and the service of the gods, and so, by purifications and sacred rites, he who has this madness is made safe for the present and the after time, and for him who is rightly possessed of madness a release from present ills is found. And a third kind of possession and madness comes from the Muses. This takes hold upon a gentle and pure soul, arouses it and inspires it to songs and other poetry, and thus by adorning countless deeds of the ancients educates later generations. But he who without the divine madness comes to the doors of the Muses, confident that he will be a good poet by art, meets with no success, and the poetry of the sane man vanishes into nothingness before that of the inspired madmen. All these noble results of inspired madness I can mention, and many more. Therefore let us not be afraid on that point, and let no one disturb and frighten us by saying that the reasonable friend should be preferred to him who is in a frenzy. Let him show in addition that love is not sent from heaven for the advantage of lover and beloved alike, and we will grant him the prize of victory. We, on our part, must prove that such madness is given by the gods for our greatest happiness ; and our proof will not be believed by the merely clever, but will be accepted by the truly wise. First, then, we must learn the truth about the soul divine and human by observing how it acts and is acted upon. And the beginning of our proof is as follows : Every soul is immortal. For that which is ever moving is immortal ; but that which moves something else or is moved by something else, when it ceases to move, ceases to live. Only that which moves itself, since it does not leave itself, never ceases to move, and this is also the source and beginning of motion for all other things which have motion. But the beginning is ungenerated. For everything that is generated must be generated from a beginning, but the beginning is not generated from anything ; for if the beginning were generated from anything, it would not be generated from a beginning. And since it is ungenerated, it must be also indestructible ; for if the beginning were destroyed, it could never be generated from anything nor anything else from it, since all things must be generated from a beginning. Thus that which moves itself must be the beginning of motion. And this can be neither destroyed nor generated, otherwise all the heavens and all generation must fall in ruin and stop and never again have any source of motion or origin. But since that which is moved by itself has been seen to be immortal, one who says that this self-motion is the essence and the very idea of the soul, will not be disgraced. For every body which derives motion from without is soulless, but that which has its motion within itself has a soul, since that is the nature of the soul ; but if this is true, that that which moves itself is nothing else than the soul, then the soul would necessarily be ungenerated and immortal. Concerning the immortality of the soul this is enough ; but about its form we must speak in the following manner. To tell what it really is would be a matter for utterly superhuman and long discourse, but it is within human power to describe it briefly in a figure ; let us therefore speak in that way. We will liken the soul to the composite nature of a pair of winged horses and a charioteer. Now the horses and charioteers of the gods are all good and of good descent, but those of other races are mixed ; and first the charioteer of the human soul drives a pair, and secondly one of the horses is noble and of noble breed, but the other quite the opposite in breed and character. Therefore in our case the driving is necessarily difficult and troublesome. Now we must try to tell why a living being is called mortal or immortal. Soul, considered collectively, has the care of all that which is soulless, and it traverses the whole heaven, appearing sometimes in one form and sometimes in another ; now when it is perfect and fully winged, it mounts upward and governs the whole world ; but the soul which has lost its wings is borne along until it gets hold of something solid, when it settles down, taking upon itself an earthly body, which seems to be self-moving, because of the power of the soul within it ; and the whole, compounded of soul and body, is called a living being, and is further designated as mortal. It is not immortal by any reasonable supposition, but we, though we have never seen or rightly conceived a god, imagine an\' immortal being which has both a soul and a body which are united for all time. Let that, however, and our words concerning it, be as is pleasing to God ; we will now consider the reason why the soul loses its wings. It is something like this. The natural function of the wing is to soar upwards and carry that which is heavy up to the place where dwells the race of the gods. More than any other thing that pertains to the body it partakes of the nature of the divine. But the divine is beauty, wisdom, goodness, and all such qualities ; by these then the wings of the soul are nourished and grow, but by the opposite qualities, such as vileness and evil, they are wasted away and destroyed. Now the great leader in heaven, Zeus, driving a winged chariot, goes first, arranging all things and caring for all things. He is followed by an army of gods and spirits, arrayed in eleven squadrons ; Hestia alone remains in the house of the gods. Of the rest, those who are included among the twelve great gods and are accounted leaders, are assigned each to his place in the army. There are many blessed sights and many ways hither and thither within the heaven, along which the blessed gods go to and fro attending each to his own duties ; and whoever wishes, and is able, follows, for jealousy is excluded from the celestial band. But when they go to a feast and a banquet, they proceed steeply upward to the top of the vault of heaven, where the chariots of the gods, whose well matched horses obey the rein, advance easily, but the others with difficulty ; for the horse of evil nature weighs the chariot down, making it heavy and pulling toward the earth the charioteer whose horse is not well trained. There the utmost toil and struggle await the soul. For those that are called immortal, when they reach the top, pass outside and take their place on the outer surface of the heaven, and when they have taken their stand, the revolution carries them round and they behold the things outside of the heaven. But the region above the heaven was never worthily sung by any earthly poet, nor will it ever be. It is, however, as I shall tell ; for I must dare to speak the truth, especially as truth is my theme. For the colourless, formless, and intangible truly existing essence, with which all true knowledge is concerned, holds this region and is visible only to the mind, the pilot of the soul. Now the divine intelligence, since it is nurtured on mind and pure knowledge, and the intelligence of every soul which is capable of receiving that which befits it, rejoices in seeing reality for a space of time and by gazing upon truth is nourished and made happy until the revolution brings it again to the same place. In the revolution it beholds absolute justice, temperance, and knowledge, not such knowledge as has a beginning and varies as it is associated with one or another of the things we call realities, but that which abides in the real eternal absolute ; and in the same way it beholds and feeds upon the other eternal verities, after which, passing down again within the heaven, it goes home, and there the charioteer puts up the horses at the manger and feeds them with ambrosia and then gives them nectar to drink. Such is the life of the gods ; but of the other souls, that which best follows after God and is most like him, raises the head of the charioteer up into the outer region and is carried round in the revolution, troubled by the horses and hardly beholding the realities ; and another sometimes rises and sometimes sinks, and, because its horses are unruly, it sees some things and fails to see others. The other souls follow after, all yearning for the upper region but unable to reach it, and are carried round beneath, trampling upon and colliding with one another, each striving to pass its neighbour. So there is the greatest confusion and sweat of rivalry, wherein many are lamed, and many wings are broken through the incompetence of the drivers ; and after much toil they all go away without gaining a view of reality, and when they have gone away they feed upon opinion. But the reason of the great eagerness to see where the plain of truth is, lies in the fact that the fitting pasturage for the best part of the soul is in the meadow there, and the wing on which the soul is raised up is nourished by this. And this is a law of Destiny, that the soul which follows after God and obtains a view of any of the truths is free from harm until the next period, and if it can always attain this, is always unharmed ; but when, through inability to follow, it fails to see, and through some mischance is filled with forgetfulness and evil and grows heavy, and when it has grown heavy, loses its wings and falls to the earth, then it is the law that this soul shall never pass into any beast at its first birth, but the soul that has seen the most shall enter into the birth of a man who is to be a philosopher or a lover of beauty, or one of a musical or loving nature, and the second soul into that of a lawful king or a warlike ruler, and the third into that of a politician or a man of business or a financier, the fourth into that of a hard-working gymnast or one who will be concerned with the cure of the body, and the fifth will lead the life of a prophet or someone who conducts mystic rites ; to the sixth, a poet or some other imitative artist will be united, to the seventh, a craftsman or a husbandman, to the eighth, a sophist or a demagogue, to the ninth, a tyrant. Now in all these states, whoever lives justly obtains a better lot, and whoever lives unjustly, a worse. For each soul returns to the place whence it came in ten thousand years ; for it does not regain its wings before that time has elapsed, except the soul of him who has been a guileless philosopher or a philosophical lover ; these, when for three successive periods of a thousand years they have chosen such a life, after the third period of a thousand years become winged in the three thousandth year and go their way ; but the rest, when they have finished their first life, receive judgment, and after the judgment some go to the places of correction under the earth and pay their penalty, while the others, made light and raised up into a heavenly place by justice, live in a manner worthy of the life they led in human form. But in the thousandth year both come to draw lots and choose their second life, each choosing whatever it wishes. Then a human soul may pass into the life of a beast, and a soul which was once human, may pass again from a beast into a man. For the soul which has never seen the truth can never pass into human form. For a human being must understand a general conception formed by collecting into a unity by means of reason the many perceptions of the senses ; and this is a recollection of those things which our soul once beheld, when it journeyed with God and, lifting its vision above the things which we now say exist, rose up into real being. And therefore it is just that the mind of the philosopher only has wings, for he is always, so far as he is able, in communion through memory with those things the communion with which causes God to be divine. Now a man who employs such memories rightly is always being initiated into perfect mysteries and he alone becomes truly perfect ; but since he separates himself from human interests and turns his attention toward the divine, he is rebuked by the vulgar, who consider him mad and do not know that he is inspired. All my discourse so far has been about the fourth kind of madness, which causes him to be regarded as mad, who, when he sees the beauty on earth, remembering the true beauty, feels his wings growing and longs to stretch them for an upward flight, but cannot do so, and, like a bird, gazes upward and neglects the things below. My discourse has shown that this is, of all inspirations, the best and of the highest origin to him who has it or who shares in it, and that he who loves the beautiful, partaking in this madness, is called a lover. For, as has been said, every soul of man has by the law of nature beheld the realities, otherwise it would not have entered into a human being, but it is not easy for all souls to gain from earthly things a recollection of those realities, either for those which had but a brief view of them at that earlier time, or for those which, after falling to earth, were so unfortunate as to be turned toward unrighteousness through some evil communications and to have forgotten the holy sights they once saw. Few then are left which retain an adequate recollection of them ; but these when they see here any likeness of the things of that other world, are stricken with amazement and can no longer control themselves ; but they do not understand their condition, because they do not clearly perceive. Now in the earthly copies of justice and temperance and the other ideas which are precious to souls there is no light, but only a few, approaching the images through the darkling organs of sense, behold in them the nature of that which they imitate, and these few do this with difficulty. But at that former time they saw beauty shining in brightness, when, with a blessed company we following in the train of Zeus, and others in that of some other god they saw the blessed sight and vision and were initiated into that which is rightly called the most blessed of mysteries, which we celebrated in a state of perfection, when we were without experience of the evils which awaited us in the time to come, being permitted as initiates to the sight of perfect and simple and calm and happy apparitions, which we saw in the pure light, being ourselves pure and not entombed in this which we carry about with us and call the body, in which we are imprisoned like an oyster in its shell.. So much, then, in honour of memory, on account of which I have now spoken at some length, through yearning for the joys of that other time. But beauty, as I said before, shone in brilliance among those visions ; and since we came to earth we have found it shining most clearly through the clearest of our senses ; for sight is the sharpest of the physical senses, though wisdom is not seen by it, for wisdom would arouse terrible love, if such a clear image of it were granted as would come through sight, and the same is true of the other lovely realities ; but beauty alone has this privilege, and therefore it is most clearly seen and loveliest. Now he who is not newly initiated, or lias been corrupted, does not quickly rise from this world to that other world and to absolute beauty when he sees its namesake here, and so he does not revere it when he looks upon it, but gives himself up to pleasure and like a beast proceeds to lust and begetting; he makes licence his companion and is not afraid or ashamed to pursue pleasure in violation of nature. But he who is newly initiated, who beheld many of those realities, when he sees a god-like face or form which is a good image of beauty, shudders at first, and something of the old awe comes over him, then, as he gazes, he reveres the beautiful one as a god, and if he did not fear to be thought stark mad, he would offer sacrifice to his beloved as to an idol or a god. And as he looks upon him, a reaction from his shuddering comes over him, with sweat and unwonted heat ; for as the effluence of beauty enters him through the eyes, he is warmed ; the effluence moistens the germ of the feathers, and as he grows warm, the parts from which the feathers grow, which were before hard and choked, and prevented the feathers from sprouting, become soft, and as the nourishment streams upon him, the quills of the feathers swell and begin to grow from the roots over all the form of the soul ; for it was once all feathered. Now in this process the whole soul throbs and palpitates, and as in those who are cutting teeth there is an irritation and discomfort in the gums, when the teeth begin to grow, just so the soul suffers when the growth of the feathers begins ; it is feverish and is uncomfortable and itches when they begin to grow. Then when it gazes upon the beauty of the boy and receives the particles which flow thence to it (for which reason they are called yearning), 1 it is moistened and warmed, ceases from its pain and is filled with joy ; but when it is alone and grows dry, the mouths of the passages in which the feathers begin to grow become dry and close up, shutting in the sprouting feathers, and the sprouts within, shut in with the yearning, throb like pulsing arteries, and each sprout pricks the passage in which it is, so that the whole soul, stung in every part, rages with pain ; and then again, remembering the beautiful one, it rejoices. So, because ot these two mingled sensations, it is greatly troubled by its strange condition ; it is perplexed and maddened, and in its madness it cannot sleep at night or stay in any one place by day, but it is filled with longing and hastens wherever it hopes to see the beautiful one. And when it sees him and is bathed with the waters of yearning, the passages that were sealed are opened, the soul has respite from the stings and is eased of its pain, and this pleasure which it enjoys is the sweetest of pleasures at the time. Therefore the soul will not, if it can help it, be left alone by the beautiful one, but esteems him above all others, forgets for hum mother and brothers and all friends, neglects property and cares not for its loss, and despising all the customs and proprieties in which it formerly took pride, it is ready to be a slave and to sleep wherever it is allowed, as near as possible to the beloved ; for it not only reveres him who possesses beauty, but finds in him the only healer of its greatest woes. Now this condition, fair boy, about which I am speaking, is called Love by men, but when you hear what the gods call it, perhaps because of your youth you will laugh. But some of the Homeridae, I believe, repeat two verses on Love from the spurious poems of Homer, one of which is very outrageous and not perfectly metrical. They sing them as follows : " Mortals call him winged Love, but the immortals call him The Winged One, because he must needs grow wings." You may believe this, or not ; but the condition of lovers and the cause of it are just as I have said. Now he who is a follower of Zeus, when seized by Love can bear a heavier burden of the winged god ; but those who are servants of Ares and followed in his train, when they have been seized by Love and think they have been wronged in any way by the beloved, become murderous and are ready to sacrifice themselves and the beloved. And so it is with the follower of each of the other gods ; he lives, so far as he is able, honouring and imitating that god, so long as he is uncorrupted, and is living his first life on earth, and in that way he behaves and conducts himself toward his beloved and toward all others. Now each one chooses his love from the ranks of the beautiful according to his character, and he fashions him and adorns him like a statue, as though he were his god, to honour and worship him. The followers of Zeus desire that the soul of him whom they love be like Zeus ; so they seek for one of philosophical and lordly nature, and when they find him and love him, they do all they can to give him such a character. If they have not previously had experience, they learn then from all who can teach them anything ; they seek after information themselves, and when they search eagerly within themselves to find the nature of their god, they are successful, because they have been compelled to keep their eyes fixed upon the god, and as they reach and grasp him by memory they are inspired and receive from him character and habits, so far as it is possible for a man to have part in God. Now they consider the beloved the cause of all this, so they love him more than before, and if they draw the waters of their inspiration from Zeus, like the bacchantes, they pour it out upon the beloved and make him, so far as possible, like their god. And those who followed after Hera seek a kingly nature, and when they have found such an one, they act in a corresponding manner toward him in all respects ; and likewise the followers of Apollo, and of each of the gods, go out and seek for their beloved a youth whose nature accords with that of the god, and when they have gained his affection, by imitating the god themselves and by persuasion and education they lead the beloved to the conduct and nature of the god, so far as each of them can do so ; they exhibit no jealousy or meanness toward the loved one, but endeavour by every means in their power to lead him to the likeness of the god whom they honour. Thus the desire of the true lovers, and the initiation into the mysteries of love, which they teach, if they accomplish what they desire in the way I describe, is beautiful and brings happiness from the inspired lover to the loved one, if he be captured ; and the fair one who is captured is caught in the following manner : In the beginning of this tale I divided each soul into three parts, two of which had the form of horses, the third that of a charioteer. Let us retain this division. Now of the horses we say one is good and the other bad ; but we did not define what the goodness of the one and the badness of the other was. That we must now do. The horse that stands at the right hand is upright and has clean limbs ; he carries his neck high, has an aquiline nose, is white in colour, and has dark eyes ; he is a friend of honour joined with temperance and modesty, and a follower of true glory ; he needs no whip, but is guided only by the word of command and by reason. The other, however, is crooked, heavy, ill put together, his neck is short and thick, his nose flat, his colour dark, his eyes grey and bloodshot ; he is the friend of insolence and pride, is shaggy-eared and deaf, hardly obedient to whip and spurs. Now when the charioteer beholds the love-inspiring vision, and his whole soul is warmed by the sight, and is full of the tickling and prickings of yearning, the horse that is obedient to the charioteer, constrained then as always by modesty, controls himself and does not leap upon the beloved ; but the other no longer heeds the pricks or the whip of the charioteer, but springs wildly forward, causing all possible trouble to his mate and to the charioteer, and forcing them to approach the beloved and propose the joys of love. And they at first pull back indignantly and will not be forced to do terrible and unlawful deeds; but finally, as the trouble has no end, they go forward with him, yielding and agreeing to do his bidding. And they come to the beloved and behold his radiant face. And as the charioteer looks upon him, his memory is borne back to the true nature of beauty, and he sees it standing with modesty upon a pedestal of chastity, and when he sees this he is afraid and falls backward in reverence, and in falling he is forced to pull the reins so violently backward as to bring both horses upon their haunches, the one quite willing, since he does not oppose him, but the unruly beast very unwilling. And as they go away, one horse in his shame and wonder wets all the soul with sweat, but the other, as soon as he is recovered from the pain of the bit and the fall, before he has fairly taken breath, breaks forth into angry reproaches, bitterly reviling his mate and the charioteer for their cowardice and lack of manhood in deserting their post and breaking their agreement ; and again, in spite of their unwillingness, he urges them forward and hardly yields to their prayer that he postpone the matter to another time. Then when the time comes which they have agreed upon, they pretend that they have forgotten it, but he reminds them ; struggling, and neighing, and pulling he forces them again with the same purpose to approach the beloved one, and when they are near him, he lowers his head, raises his tail, takes the bit in his teeth, and pulls shamelessly. The effect upon the charioteer is the same as before, but more pronounced ; he falls back like a racer from the starting-rope, pulls the bit backward even more violently than before from the teeth of the unruly horse, covers his scurrilous tongue and jaws with blood, and forces his legs and haunches to the ground, causing him much pain. Now when the bad horse has gone through the same experience many times and has ceased from his unruliness, he is humbled and follows henceforth the wisdom of the charioteer, and when he sees the beautiful one, he is overwhelmed with fear ; and so from that time on the soul of the lover follows the beloved in reverence and .awe. Now the beloved, since he receives all service from his lover, as if he were a god, and since the lover is not feigning, but is really in love, and since the beloved himself is by nature friendly to him who serves him, although he may at some earlier time have been prejudiced by his schoolfellows or others, who said that it was a disgrace to yield to a lover, and may for that reason have repulsed his lover, yet, as time goes on, his youth and destiny cause him to admit him to his society. For it is the law of fate that evil can never be a friend to evil and that good must always be friend to good. And when the lover is thus admitted, and the privilege of conversation and intimacy has been granted him, his good will, as it shows itself in close intimacy, astonishes the beloved, who discovers that the friendship of all his other friends and relatives is as nothing when compared with that of his inspired lover. And as this intimacy continues and the lover comes near and touches the beloved in the gymnasia and in their general intercourse, then the fountain of that stream which Zeus, when he was in love with Ganymede, called " desire " flows copiously upon the lover ; and some of it flows into him, and some, when he is filled, overflows outside ; and just as the wind or an echo rebounds from smooth, hard surfaces and returns whence it came, so the stream of beauty passes back into the beautiful one through the eyes, the natural inlet to the soul, where it reanimates the passages of the feathers, waters them and makes the feathers begin to grow, filling the soul of the loved one with love. So he is in love, but he knows not with whom ; he does not understand his own condition and cannot explain it ; like one who has caught a disease of the eyes from another, he can give no reason for it ; he sees himself in his lover as in a mirror, but is not conscious of the fact. And in the lover\'s presence, like him he ceases from his pain, and in his absence, like him he is filled with yearning such as he inspires, and love\'s image, requited love, dwells within him ; but he calls it, and believes it to be, not love, but friendship. Like the lover, though less strongly, he desires to see his friend, to touch him, kiss him, and lie down by him ; and naturally these things are soon brought about. Now as they lie together, the unruly horse of the lover has something to say to the charioteer, and demands a little enjoyment in return for his many troubles ; and the unruly horse of the beloved says nothing, but teeming with passion and confused emotions he embraces and kisses his lover, caressing him as his best friend ; and when they lie together, he would not refuse his lover any favour, if he asked it ; but the other horse and the charioteer oppose all this with modesty and reason. If now the better elements of the mind, which lead to a well ordered life and to philosophy, prevail, they live a life of happiness and harmony here on earth, self controlled and orderly, holding in subjection that which causes evil in the soul and giving freedom to that which makes for virtue ; and when this life is ended they are light and winged, for they have conquered in one of the three truly Olympic contests. Neither human wisdom nor divine inspiration can confer upon man any greater blessing than this. If however they live a life less noble and without philosophy, but yet ruled by the love of honour, probably, when they have been drinking, or in some other moment of carelessness, the two unruly horses, taking the souls off their guard, will bring them together and seize upon and accomplish that which is by the many accounted blissful ; and when this has once been done, they continue the practice, but infrequently, since what they are doing is not approved by the whole mind. So these two pass through life as friends, though not such friends as the others, both at the time of their love and afterwards, believing that they have exchanged the most binding pledges of love, and that they can never break them and fall into enmity. And at last, when they depart from the body, they are not winged, to be sure, but their wings have begun to grow, so that the madness of love brings them no small reward ; for it is the law that those who have once begun their upward progress shall never again pass into darkness and the journey under the earth, but shall live a happy life in the light as they journey together, and because of their love shall be alike in their plumage when they receive their wings. These blessings, so great and so divine, the friendship of a lover will confer upon you, dear boy ; but the affection of the non-lover, which is alloyed with mortal prudence and follows mortal and parsimonious rules of conduct, will beget in the beloved soul the narrowness which the common folk praise as virtue ; it will cause the soul to be a wanderer upon the earth for nine thousand years and a fool below the earth at last. There, dear Love, thou hast my recantation, which I have offered and paid as beautifully and as well as I could, especially in the poetical expressions which I was forced to employ on account of Phaedrus. Pardon, I pray, my former words and accept these words with favour ; be kind and gracious to me ; do not in anger take from me the art of love which thou didst give me, and deprive me not of sight, but grant unto me to be even more than now esteemed by the beautiful. And if in our former discourse Phaedrus and I said anything harsh against thee, blame Lysias, the father of that discourse, make him to cease from such speeches, and turn him, as his brother Polemarchus is turned, toward philosophy, that his lover Phaedrus may no longer hesitate, as he does now, between two ways, but may direct his life with all singleness of purpose toward love and philosophical discourses.']},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["I join in your prayer, Socrates, and pray that this may come to pass, if this is best for us.

To him came Theuth to show his inventions, saying that they ought to be imparted to the other Egyptians. But Thamus asked what use there was in each, and as Theuth enumerated their uses, expressed praise or blame, according as he approved or disapproved. The story goes that Thamus said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would take too long to repeat ; but when they came to the letters, " This invention, O king," said Theuth, "will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories ; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered." But Thamus replied, " Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another ; and now you, who are the father of letters, have been led by your affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess. For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding ; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise."']},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["Socrates, you easily make up stories of Egypt or any country you please."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["They used to say, my friend, that the words of the oak in the holy place of Zeus at Dodona were the first prophetic utterances.

And so the large field offers you a much better chance of finding someone worthy of your affection.","Now, if you are worried about the moral code\u2014about the stigma that might attach to you if people found out\u2014it stands to reason that a lover, because he thinks that everyone else considers him just as happy as he does himself, will be stimulated by talking about it, and will proudly point out to everyone that his efforts were not in vain,","while a non-lover, who is in control of himself, will choose the best course of action, rather than a worldly reputation.","Moreover, a lover is bound to be found out. He will be seen by many people trailing along after his beloved and making this his chief business,","and so when he and his beloved are spotted talking to each other, people think they are together at that time because they have just satisfied their desires or are just about to.","But it never even crosses their minds to criticize non-lovers for spending time together, because they realize that conversation is inevitable between friends or people enjoying themselves in some other way.","Also, if you are worried by the thought that it is hard for a relationship to last, but that although breaking up normally troubles both friends equally, it would be you who would suffer badly since you have given away what you value most,","it is reasonable for you to be more concerned about a lover than a non-lover, because a lover is easily upset and thinks that everything is designed to do him harm.","That is also why he tries to stop his beloved spending time with others, because he is afraid that those who are well off will prove to have more money than him and that those who have been educated will be more knowledgeable than him\u2014","and he is concerned about what anyone with any other advantage might be able to do.","A lover will therefore persuade you to put these people off, until you reach a state of complete isolation from friends, and if you are more clever than him and look to your own advantage, you will cause a rift between yourself and him.","Someone who is not in love, however, but got what he wanted as a result of his excellent qualities, will not mind others spending time with you,","and in fact will be deeply suspicious of an unwillingness to do so, which he will take as a sign of their wanting to have nothing to do with him, while he will think of the benefit he could gain from those who do spend time with you. The upshot is that a non-lover can be far more hopeful of gaining friendship rather than antagonism as a result of the affair.","Also, it is commonly the case that a lover desires his beloved's body before he has come to appreciate his character or got to know his other attributes.","This should make the beloved wonder whether a lover will still want to be his friend when his desire has come to an end.","A couple who are not in love, however, were friendly with each other even before they consummated their affair, and the favours they do each other are unlikely to lessen their friendship, but are more likely to remain as indicators of more to come in the future.","Also, you can expect to become a better person if you listen to what I say than if you listen to a lover.","A lover praises the things his beloved says and does even when they do not conform with morality, partly because he is afraid of being disliked, partly because his judgement is impaired by his desire.","After all, here are some typical manifestations of love.","Love makes a lover count as disastrous setbacks which cause no one else any distress at all, and when things are going well love compels him to praise even things which ought not to give him pleasure.","Pity, then, rather than admiration, would be a far more appropriate response for a beloved to show a lover.","But if you listen to me, first, when I am with you, I will not be a slave to immediate pleasure, but will look to the beneficial future results of our relationship; I will not be overcome by love, but will be in control of myself;","I will not let trivia arouse me to violent hostility, though important issues will gradually make me a little angry; I will forgive unintentional errors and try to stop you making intentional mistakes before they happen.","This all goes to show that our relationship would last a long time.","If it happens to have occurred to you that there can be no real warmth in a relationship unless your partner is in love, you should bear in mind that, if this were so, we would not value our sons or parents,","nor would we have good friends, whose friendship does not depend on the kind of desire a lover has, but on other aspirations.","Moreover, it follows from the principle that we should make a particular point of gratifying those who particularly need our favours, that in other respects too it is the most needy people, rather than the best people, whom we should be helping, since they will be especially grateful for their release from especially grim circumstances.","And the same goes for our private dinner-parties too: we should not invite our friends, but those who beg for food and need filling up, because it is they who will be appreciative, who will follow us around, call at our house, feel the greatest pleasure, be extremely grateful, and pray for us to be showered with blessings.","No, perhaps you should gratify those who are best able to repay the favour, rather than those who are especially needy; those who deserve what you have to give, rather than those who merely beg for it;","those who will share their own goods with you when you are older, rather than those who merely appreciate your youthful charms; those who will always maintain a discreet silence, rather than those who will boast to others of their success;","those who will be lifelong friends, rather than those who pursue you for a short while; those who will take the passing of your youthful charms as an opportunity to display their own good qualities, rather than those who will make the end of their desire an excuse for breaking up with you.","You should remember what I have been saying and bear this in mind: while in the case of lovers their friends tell them off for the depravity of what they are up to, no friend or relation has ever criticized a non-lover for letting an affair impair his judgement about what is best for himself.","Now, you might be wondering, perhaps, whether I am suggesting that you gratify every man who is not in love with you.","In the first place, I am sure that a lover would not tell you to have this attitude towards every lover either, because then the favours you grant would not deserve the same degree of gratitude from their recipients, nor, if you wanted to, would you be able to keep an affair secret from everyone else as well as you might otherwise.","In the second place, then, no harm should accrue from this business, but only good, for both parties.","I think that I have said enough to make my point. If you think I have left anything out and you want to hear further arguments, you have only to ask.","So how does the speech strike you, Socrates?

Once upon a time there was a boy, or rather a young man, who was very beautiful, and he had a great many lovers. One of these lovers was a cunning man, and although he was in love with the boy as much as anyone, he had convinced him that he was not. The time came when, in order to try to seduce the boy, he set about persuading him of precisely this point, that he should gratify a non-lover rather than a lover. And this is what he said: 'Whatever the issue, my young friend, if you want to come to a correct conclusion there is only one place to start your deliberations. If you lack knowledge of whatever it is you are thinking about, you are bound to go wrong. Now, most people fail to appreciate their ignorance of the true nature of any given thing, proceed on the assumption that they do know, and end up paying the penalty you'd expect, of agreeing neither with themselves nor with anyone else. I don't want you and me to experience what we criticize in others. No, because the issue before us is whether one should enter into a relationship with a lover or a non-lover, we should establish a mutually acceptable definition of love\u2014of what kind of thing it is, and what its powers are\u2014and then we can conduct our enquiry into whether it is beneficial or harmful with this definition before us as a benchmark and a point of reference. 'Well, then, it is clear to everyone that love is a kind of desire, and we also know that even non-lovers desire the beauty in people and things. So how shall we tell a lover from a non-lover? We must next bear in mind that in each of us there are two ruling and guiding forces whose lead we follow: one is our innate desire for pleasures, and the other is an acquired mode of thought, which aims for what is best. These two forces in us sometimes work together, but sometimes conflict, and at different times one or the other of them is in command. When thought is in command and is leading us rationally towards what is best, the name we give to its rule is self-control. When desire is in command and is dragging us irrationally towards pleasures, we call its rule excess. Now, excess has many names, because it is a thing of many limbs and parts, and a person in its grip gains an ugly, pejorative name according to which of the many types of excess happens to dominate at the time. When the desire for food conquers one's reasoning about what is best and overpowers the other desires, it is called gluttony and someone in its grip gains exactly that name. Or again, when someone is ruled by the desire for alcohol and is led in that direction, we all know what name he gains for himself. And so on: in the case of all the related names of these and related desires, we can easily see that people are called by the appropriate name, depending on whichever desire is in control. We are already more or less in a position to understand the desire which all these preliminaries were leading up to, but it is always clearer to have something openly stated rather than leaving it implicit. So when irrational desire rules one's reasoned impulse to do right and is carried towards pleasure in beauty, and when this irrational desire has also been powerfully reinforced in its attraction towards physical beauty by the desires that are related to it, and has gained the upper hand thanks to this power, it is named after that very strength, and is called love.' Anyway, my dear Phaedrus, do you think I've been inspired by a god? I do."]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["Well, it's certainly true that you're being unusually eloquent, Socrates."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Keep quiet and listen to me, then. For in fact this spot really does seem infused with divinity, so don't be surprised if, as may happen, I become possessed by the Nymphs as my speech progresses. As it is I'm already more or less chanting dithyrambs."]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["You're quite right."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["It's your fault. But listen to the rest of the speech. After all, the fit might be averted, I suppose. But we had better leave this in the hands of the gods, while we resume the speech to the boy. 'All right, then, brave heart. Now that we have stated and defined the matter we have to think about, we can refer to it in what follows and say what benefit or damage is likely to accrue from a lover or a non-lover to the person who gratifies either of them. A man who is ruled by desire and is a slave to pleasure is surely bound to see to it that his beloved gives him as much pleasure as possible. Now, someone who is sick finds pleasant only things which offer him no resistance, while he hates anything which is stronger than him, or just as strong as him. So a lover will not be happy with a beloved who is superior to him, or his equal, and he will always try to make him weaker and inferior. Now, a stupid person is inferior to a clever one, a cowardly person is inferior to a brave one, one who finds it impossible to speak in public is inferior to an orator, and a dull-witted person is inferior to a quick-witted one. A lover is bound to find pleasant the occurrence and the natural presence in his beloved of not just these terrible afflictions, but even more besides, and he will make sure that his beloved has them, so as not to risk losing his short-term pleasure. He is bound to be jealous, then, and because he stops him entering into a number of other beneficial relationships, which might have gone a long way towards developing his potential, he is bound to harm him a great deal, and a very great deal if he denies him the kind of relationship which would develop his intellectual capacities. This, in fact, would come about from the divine pursuit, philosophy, which a lover is bound to keep his beloved far away from, for fear of finding himself an object of contempt. And in general he will ensure that his beloved remains utterly ignorant and utterly dependent on him, in which state the beloved will give the greatest pleasure to his lover, but do the greatest harm to himself. Anyway, as far as the mind is concerned, there is no advantage at all in having as your guardian and partner a man who is in love. 'Next we must turn to your physical state and care of the body, and try to see how and in what way a man who is compelled to make pleasure rather than goodness his goal will treat a body which he is in charge of. You will soon see that he chases after someone who is soft, not hard, someone who has been brought up in hazy shade rather than in the pure light of the sun and who has no experience of manly toil and dried sweat, but has plenty of experience of a comfortable and effeminate way of life, someone who prettifies himself with alien colours and make-up because he has none of his own, and whose other pursuits are all in keeping with those we have already mentioned. They are obvious and there is nothing to be gained by adding to the list, but we can move on once we have briefly stated the main point: in times of war and other important crises, a body of this kind encourages your enemies and dismays your friends and even your lovers themselves. 'All this is too obvious to need saying, but next it does need to be asked what benefit or harm the company and protection of a lover will do as far as possessions are concerned. Now, if there is anything of which everyone, but especially a lover, is aware it is that he would pray above all else for his beloved to lose his most precious, kind, and divine possessions. For he would gladly see him deprived of his father, mother, relatives, and friends, whom he regards as obstacles to and critics of what gives him the greatest pleasure\u2014spending time with his beloved. Also, in his opinion, the possession of gold or other valuables makes a boy less easy to catch, and less tame when caught, and from this it clearly follows that a lover hates it when his beloved has possessions, and loves to see him lose them. Then again, a lover would pray for his beloved to be without wife, children, and home for as long as possible, because he wants to spend as long as possible plucking the fruit he finds sweet. 'There are plenty of other evils, but thanks to some deity or other most of them do involve short-term pleasure. Take a parasite, for example: he is a formidable creature and a source of considerable harm, but he naturally involves a not unrefined kind of pleasure. Again, although one might criticize prostitutes as harmful, along with many other such creatures and pursuits, they are very enjoyable, in an ephemeral fashion. Not only does a lover harm his beloved, however, but there is no pleasure at all to be had in his company. After all, as the old saying says, youth pleases youth\u2014presumably because people of the same age have the same pleasures and this similarity makes them friends\u2014but one can see too much even of one's peers. 'Furthermore, in every walk of life pressure is a nuisance for anyone. And apart from the difference in their ages a lover exerts enormous pressure on his beloved. For in such a relationship the older man is reluctant to leave the younger at any time of the day or night; he is driven by compulsion, stung by a goad which, by constantly giving him pleasure when he sees, hears, touches, or otherwise perceives his beloved, induces him to find pleasure in being the boy's attentive servant. But what kind of consolation or pleasure can he offer his beloved to stop him being absolutely disgusted by spending all that time with him? He sees a face which is aged and past its prime, and everything else that goes with that, which it is unpleasant even to hear about, let alone being pressurized into experiencing the actuality of it. He is watched constantly and suspiciously in all his dealings with other people, he listens to excessive and inappropriate praise and to the same sort of criticism, which is intolerable when his lover is sober, and embarrassing as well as intolerable when he is drunk and talks with tiresome and unrestrained candour. 'A lover in love damages and disgusts his beloved, but once he has fallen out of love he is no longer to be trusted, for all the promises he made about the future, and for all the oaths and entreaties with which he accompanied those promises, as a barely successful ploy to offset the arduous nature of his company with the hope of advantages to come and so have his beloved stay with him for the time being. Later, then, when he ought to be fulfilling these promises, he swaps one internal ruler and master for another, and listens to sanity and common sense rather than love and madness. His beloved, however, does not realize that he has changed; he demands kindness from him in return for favours granted earlier, and reminds him of things he did and said, as if he were talking to the same man. The lover, meanwhile, is too embarrassed to admit that he has changed, and is also incapable of fulfilling the oaths and promises of the earlier, insane regime, because he has now come to his senses and recovered his sanity, and does not want to turn back into the same person he was before as a result of doing the same things as then. And so he tries to flee his responsibilities. Compelled to default by the change he has undergone, the former lover, at the flip of a sherd, turns to flight. The beloved is then forced to chase after him, cursing in his frustration, and completely and utterly failing to appreciate that he should never gratify someone who is in love and who is bound to be out of his mind, but would do much better to gratify someone who is not in love with him and is sane. Otherwise, he is bound to be surrendering himself to a man who is untrustworthy, bad-tempered, jealous, unpleasant, and harmful not just to his property and his physical condition, but even more so to his mental development, which is in actual fact the most valuable thing there is or ever will be in the eyes of both gods and men. 'All this, then, young man, is what you have to bear in mind. You should realize that kindness is not involved in a relationship with a lover. For him it is like food, just so that he can be filled up. Lovers love a young man like yourself as wolves love lambs!' That's it, Phaedrus. I have nothing to add to what I've said, and you must take my speech as ended."]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["But I thought you were only halfway through, and would talk at the same length about the non-lover\u2014 about how it is preferable for the boy to gratify him\u2014and would explain all the advantages he brings.

Why?"]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Didn't you notice, my friend, that I've stopped chanting dithyrambs and am now coming up with epic verse, even though I'm finding fault with things?

I shall say only, in a word, that the non-lover has all the advantages opposed to the attributes we criticized in the lover. So what need is there of a long speech? I've said enough about them both. In this situation the tale I have told will meet with the appropriate fate, and I am going to cross this river and leave before you force me to do something even worse."]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["Not yet, Socrates\u2014not while it's so hot.

I seemed to hear a sudden voice telling me not to leave until I have purified myself from some offence or other which I have committed against the realm of the gods. Now, I may not be a very good one, but I am a seer. I'm like people who are bad at writing: I'm good enough only for my own purposes. And so I do already understand beyond the shadow of a doubt what my offence was. After all, the soul too has something of the same ability that seers possess. Just now, when I was delivering my speech, something disturbed me, and I was rather worried, as Ibycus says, 'lest the cost of winning honour among men is that I sin in the eyes of the gods'.

But if Love is a god, or at least divine, as indeed he is, he cannot be bad, but both the speeches which have just been given about him made him out to be bad. Not only did they commit this offence against Love, but their stupidity attained exquisite heights: although everything they said was unsound and false, they gave themselves solemn airs as if they were important, to see if they could deceive some pathetic people into admiring them. And so I must purify myself, my friend. Now, there's an ancient tradition governing how those who commit an offence in the domain of story-telling have to purify themselves, which Homer may have failed to recognize, but Stesichorus didn't. After losing his sight as a result of slandering Helen, Stesichorus didn't fail to recognize his fault, as Homer had. No, as a man of culture he recognized how he had sinned and immediately composed the following lines: False was the tale I told. You did not travel on the fair-decked ship, Nor came to the citadel of Troy. And no sooner had he finished composing the entire Palinode, as it is called, than he regained his sight. Well, I shall prove myself cleverer than them in one respect, anyway: I shall try to recompense Love with my palinode before anything happens to me as a result of slandering him, and I shall not keep my head covered out of embarrassment as I did before, but shall speak with my head exposed."]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["You couldn't have said anything which would make me happier, Socrates."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["That, my dear Phaedrus, is because you're aware how shameless the two speeches were, the one given just now and the one read out from the scroll.

I want him to hear the speech too, and not to rush off and gratify a non-lover without having heard what I have to say."]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["He's always right here by your side, whenever you need him."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["What I'd like you to realize, you gorgeous young man, is that the previous speech was by Phaedrus the son of Pythocles, of the deme Myrrhinous, and that the one I'm just about to give will be by Stesichorus the son of Euphemus, from Himera. Here's what I have to say: '\u201cFalse was the tale\u201d that you should gratify a non-lover rather than a lover (supposing you have one), just because a lover is mad and a non-lover is sane. If madness were simply an evil, it would be right, but in fact some of our greatest blessings come from madness, when it is granted to us as a divine gift. For instance, the prophetess at Delphi and the priestesses at Dodona have done Greece a lot of good\u2014not only individuals, but whole communities\u2014in their madness, but little or nothing when they are in their right minds. And if we are to mention the Sibyl and all the others who, when possessed by a god, use prophecy to predict the future and have on numerous occasions pointed a lot of people in the right direction, we would only be lengthening our account with information that was already completely familiar. 'But it is worth mentioning as evidence that the people who made up our language long ago were also of the opinion that madness was not appalling or disgraceful. Otherwise they would not have linked this word, \u201cmadness\u201d, with the wonderful art of foretelling the future by calling it \u201cinsanity\u201d [manike\xaf]. No, they gave this wonderful art its name on the assumption that madness is fine, when it comes from divine dispensation, but people nowadays are ignorant of such nuances and so they insert the \u201ct\u201d and call it \u201cprophecy\u201d [mantike\xaf]. By the same token, when they named the investigation of the future by people who are in their right minds, which is carried out by means of birds and other signs, they called it \u201caugury\u201d [oiono\xefstike\xaf] because it gives the human mind [oie\xafsis] insight [nous] and information [historia] in a rational way, although nowadays people call it oio\xafnistike\xaf to make it sound more special with a long \u201co\u201d. So, because prophecy is more complete and valuable than augury\u2014not just because it has a superior name, but also because its achievements are superior \u2014those men of old were indicating that god-given madness is better than human sanity. 'Then again, madness enters certain famous families which have been afflicted by horrendous illnesses and suffering as a result of guilt incurred some time in the distant past, and with prophetic insight finds the necessary means of relief. It resorts to prayer and worship of the gods, and when, as a result of this, it comes up with purificatory rituals, it makes the madman better, not just temporarily, but for the future too. And so it finds a way to release people who are mad and possessed in the right fashion from the evils that afflict them. 'A third kind of possession and madness comes from the Muses. It takes hold of a delicate, virgin soul and stirs it into a frenzy for composing lyric and other kinds of poetry, and so educates future generations by glorifying the countless deeds of the past. But anyone who approaches the doors of poetic composition without the Muses' madness, in the conviction that skill alone will make him a competent poet, is cheated of his goal. In his sanity both he and his poetry are eclipsed by poetry composed by men who are mad. 'So there are some examples of the fine results of god-sent madness; I could mention even more as well. And the upshot is that we should not be afraid of madness, and should not be alarmed by the argument, designed to frighten us, that we should prefer a sane man over a passionate one as our friend. This argument can win the day only if it can also show that love is not sent by the gods to benefit the lover and his beloved. Meanwhile, it is up to us to prove, on the contrary, that this kind of madness is given by the gods to help us achieve the greatest happiness\u2014a proof which will be believed by the wise, if not the clever. 'First we have to understand the truth about the nature of the soul, whether divine or human, by considering what happens to it and what it causes to happen. This gives us the following starting-point for our proof. Every soul is immortal, because anything that is ever-moving is immortal, whereas anything which causes motion elsewhere and is moved from elsewhere stops living when it stops moving. It is only something which moves itself that never stops moving, because it never abandons itself. Such a thing is also the original source of motion for everything else that moves. Now, a source is ungenerated, because everything that is generated is necessarily generated from a source, but there is nothing for a source to be generated from. For if a source were generated from anything, it would stop being a source. Since a source is ungenerated, it is also necessarily imperishable, because a defunct source can never be generated from anything else nor can it bring about generation in anything else, given that everything is generated from a source. And so it is a self-mover that is a source of motion, and a self-mover can neither perish nor be generated, or else the entire universe and the whole of creation will inevitably run down and stop, and will never again find anything to act as a source of motion and generation. Now, we have already shown that a self-mover is immortal, and so no one need hesitate to claim that self-movement is the essence and principle of soul. For no body which is moved from outside itself has a soul, while every body which is moved from within itself, from its own resources, has a soul, since this is what it is to be soul. If this is so\u2014if souls and only souls are self-movers\u2014it necessarily follows that soul is ungenerated and immortal. 'That is enough about the soul's immortality. I must now say something about its character. It would take too long\u2014and beyond the slightest shadow of a doubt require a god\u2014to explain its character, but the use of an analogy will make the task within lesser human powers. So let's do that. In my analogy, a soul is like an organic whole made up of a charioteer and his team of horses. Now, while the horses and charioteers of gods are always thoroughly good, those of everyone else are a mixture. Although our inner ruler drives a pair of horses, only one of his horses is thoroughly noble and good, while the other is thoroughly the opposite. This inevitably makes driving, in our case, difficult and disagreeable. 'Next I must try to explain how one living creature is called \u201cimmortal\u201d while another is called \u201cmortal\u201d. It is the job of soul in general to look after all that is inanimate, and souls patrol the whole universe, taking on different forms at different times. A complete soul\u2014which is to say, one that is winged \u2014journeys on high and controls the whole world, but one that has lost its wings is carried along until it seizes upon something solid, and it takes up residence there. The earthy body of which it takes control seems to move itself, but that is the effect of the soul, and the whole unit of soul and body conjoined is called a \u201cliving creature\u201d, and also \u201cmortal\u201d. No one who has thought the matter through could call a living creature \u201cimmortal\u201d, but because we have never seen a god, and have an inadequate conception of godhood, we imagine a kind of immortal living creature, possessing both soul and body in an everlasting combination. Anyway, we can leave the facts of this matter to be and be expressed however the gods like, but we have to come to some understanding of what causes a soul to shed and lose its wings. It is something like this. 'The natural property of a wing is to carry something heavy aloft, up on high to the abode of the gods. There is a sense in which, of all the things that are related to the body, wings have more of the divine in them. Anything divine is good, wise, virtuous, and so on, and so these qualities are the best source of nourishment and growth for the soul's wings, but badness and evil and so on cause them to shrink and perish. 'The supreme leader in the heavens is Zeus. He goes at the head, in a winged chariot, arranging and managing everything, and behind him comes the host of gods and spirits, in an orderly array of eleven squadrons. For Hestia stays alone in the gods' house, while each of the other gods who have been assigned one of the twelve positions takes his place at the head of the rank to which he has been assigned. So there are many glorious sights to be seen within heaven, and many wonderful paths along which the favoured company of gods go and return, each performing his proper function, and the gods are accompanied by everyone who wants to join them and is capable of doing so, because meanness has no place in the gods' choir. When they turn to food and go to one of their banquets, they journey skyward to the rim of the heavenly vault. b Although the way is steep, the gods' chariots make light of the journey, since they are well balanced and easy to handle, but the other chariots find it hard, because the troublesome horse weighs them down. Any charioteer who has trained this horse imperfectly finds that it pulls him down towards the earth and holds him back, and this is the point at which a soul faces the worst suffering and the hardest struggle. 'When the souls we call \u201cimmortal\u201d reach the rim, they make their way to the outside and stand on the outer edge of heaven, and as they stand there the revolution carries them around, while they gaze outward from the heaven. The region beyond heaven has never yet been adequately described in any of our earthly poets' compositions, nor will it ever be. But since one has to make a courageous attempt to speak the truth, especially when it is truth that one is speaking about, here is a description. This region is filled with true being. True being has no colour or form; it is intangible, and visible only to intelligence, the soul's guide. True being is the province of everything that counts as true knowledge. So since the mind of god is nourished by intelligence and pure knowledge (as is the mind of every soul which is concerned to receive its proper food), it is pleased to be at last in a position to see true being, and in gazing on the truth it is fed and feels comfortable, until the revolution carries it around to the same place again. In the course of its circuit it observes justice as it really is, self-control, knowledge\u2014not the kind of knowledge that is involved with change and differs according to which of the various existing things (to use the term \u201cexistence\u201d in its everyday sense) it makes its object, but the kind of knowledge whose object is things as they really are. And once it has feasted its gaze in the same way on everything else that really is, it sinks back into the inside of heaven and returns home. Once back home, the soul's charioteer reins in his horses by their manger, throws them ambrosia to eat, and gives them nectar to wash the ambrosia down. 'This is how the gods live. As for the other souls, any that have closely followed a god and have come to resemble him most raise the heads of their charioteers into the region outside and are carried around along with the revolution, but they are disturbed by their horses and their view of things as they really are is uncertain. Others poke their heads through from time to time, but sink back down in between, and so they see some things, but miss others, depending on the resistance offered by their horses. The rest all long for the upper region and follow after, but they cannot break through, and they are carried around under the surface, trampling and bumping into one another as one tries to overtake another. So there is utter chaos, nothing but sweat and conflict. In the course of this confusion many souls are crippled as a result of the incompetence of the charioteers, and many have their wings severely damaged, but even after all this effort none of them succeeds in seeing things as they really are before having to return and rely on specious nourishment. 'The reason why there is so much determination to see the whereabouts of the plain of truth is not only that the proper food for the best part of the soul happens to come from the meadow there, but also that it is in the nature of the wings which raise the soul to be nourished by this region. It is the decree of destiny that any soul which attends a god and catches even a glimpse of the truth remains free from injury until the next revolution, and if it is able to do this every time, it will continue to be free from harm. But souls which fall behind and lose their vision of the truth, and are for some unfortunate reason or another weighed down by being filled with forgetfulness and weakness, lose their wings thanks to this burden and fall to earth. At this point they are subject to a law that they are not to be planted into the bodies of animals in their first incarnation. The souls which have seen the most are to enter the seeds of men who will become philosophers, lovers of beauty, men of culture, men who are dedicated to love; the second group those of law-abiding kings or military commanders or civic leaders; the third group those of politicians, estate-managers or businessmen; the fourth group those of men who love exercising in a gymnasium or future experts in bodily health; the fifth group will live as prophets or as initiators into one of the mystery cults; the sixth group will most suitably live as poets or some other kind of representative artist, the seventh as artisans or farmers, the eighth as sophists or demagogues, and the ninth as tyrants. 'In all these cases anyone who has lived a moral life will obtain a better fate, and anyone who has lived an immoral life the opposite. For no soul returns to the place it fell from for ten thousand years\u2014it takes that long for wings to grow again \u2014except the soul of a man who has practiced philosophy with sincerity or combined his love for a boy with the practice of philosophy. At the completion of the third thousand-year circuit, if these souls have chosen the philosophical life three times in succession, they regain their wings and in the three-thousandth year they return. But all the other souls are judged after the end of their first life, and once they have been judged they either go to prisons in the underworld where they are punished, or are raised aloft by Justice to a certain place in the heavens and live as they deserve, depending on how they lived when they were in human form. But in the thousandth year both groups of souls come for the allotment and choice of their second life and each of them chooses the life it likes. This is the point at which a human soul can be reincarnated as an animal, and someone who was formerly human can be reborn as a human being once again, instead of being an animal. For a soul which has never seen the truth cannot enter into human form, because a man must understand the impressions he receives by reference to classes: he draws on the plurality of perceptions to combine them by reasoning into a single class. This is recollection of the things which our souls once saw during their journey as companions to a god, when they saw beyond the things we now say \u201cexist\u201d and poked their heads up into true reality. That is why only the mind of a philosopher deserves to grow wings, because it uses memory to remain always as close as possible to those things proximity to which gives a god his divine qualities. By making correct use of reminders of these things a man, being constantly initiated into the most perfect rites of all, becomes the only one who is truly perfect. But since he is remote from human concerns and close to divinity, he is criticized by the general run of mankind as deranged, because they do not realize that he is possessed by a god. 'Now we reach the point to which the whole discussion of the fourth kind of madness was tending. This fourth kind of madness is the kind which occurs when someone sees beauty here on earth and is reminded of true beauty. His wings begin to grow and he wants to take to the air on his new plumage, but he cannot; like a bird he looks upwards, and because he ignores what is down here, he is accused of behaving like a madman. So the point is that this turns out to be the most thoroughly good of all kinds of possession, not only for the man who is possessed, but also for anyone who is touched by it, and the word \u201clover\u201d refers to a lover of beauty who has been possessed by this kind of madness. For, as I have already said, the soul of every human being is bound to have seen things as they really are, or else it would not have entered this kind of living creature. 'But not every soul is readily prompted by things here on earth to recall those things that are real. This is not easy for souls which caught only a brief glimpse of things there, nor for those which after falling to earth have suffered the misfortune of being perverted and made immoral by the company they keep and have forgotten the sacred things they saw then. When the remaining few, whose memories are good enough, see a likeness here which reminds them of things there, they are amazed and beside themselves, but they do not understand what is happening to them because of a certain unclarity in their perceptions. But although the likenesses here on earth (of things which are precious to souls, such as justice and self-control) lack all lustre, and only a few people come to them and barely see, through dim sense organs, what it is that any likeness is a likeness of, yet earlier it was possible for them to see beauty in all its brilliance. That was when\u2014we as attendants of Zeus and others of one of the other gods\u2014as part of a happy company they saw a wonderful sight and spectacle and were initiated into what we may rightly call the most wonderful of the mysteries. When we celebrated these mysteries then, we were not only perfect beings ourselves, untouched by all the troubles which awaited us later, but we also were initiated into and contemplated things shown to us that were perfect, simple, stable, and blissful. We were surrounded by rays of pure light, being pure ourselves and untainted by this object we call a \u201cbody\u201d and which we carry around with us now, imprisoned like shellfish. 'Let this be my tribute to memory; it was remembering and longing for those past events which has made me go on rather too long now. But turning to beauty, it shone out, as I said, among its companions there, and once here on earth we found, by means of the clearest of our senses, that it sparkles with particular clarity. For the keenest kind of perception the body affords us is the one that comes through seeing, though we are not able to see wisdom, because as with everything else which is an object of love, wisdom would cause terrible pangs of love in us if it presented some kind of clear image of itself by approaching our organ of sight. But as things are, it is only beauty which has the property of being especially visible and especially lovable. Anyone who was initiated long ago or who has been corrupted is not given to moving rapidly from here to there, towards beauty as it really is. Instead, he gazes on its namesake here on earth, and the upshot is that the sight does not arouse reverence in him. No, he surrenders to pleasure and tries like an animal to mount his partner and to father offspring, and having become habituated to excess he is not afraid or ashamed to pursue unnatural pleasures. But when someone who has only recently been initiated, and who took in plenty of the sights to be seen then, sees a marvellous face or a bodily form which is a good reflection of beauty, at first he shivers and is gripped by something like the fear he felt then, and the sight also moves him to revere his beloved as if he were a god. In fact, it is only concern about being thought completely insane that stops him from sacrificing to his beloved as if he were a cult statue or a god. 'Following this sight, the kind of change comes over him that you would expect after a shivering fit, and he begins to sweat and to run an unusually high fever, because the reception through his eyes of the effusion of beauty causes him to get hot. Now, this effusion is also the natural means of irrigating his wings. His heat softens the coat covering the feathers' buds, which had been too hard and closed up for wings to grow. As further nourishment pours in, the quills of the feathers swell and begin to grow from the roots upwards and to spread all over the under side of the soul, because previously the whole soul was winged. At this point, then, his whole soul seethes and pounds\u2014in fact, the soul of someone who is beginning to grow wings experiences exactly the same sensations that children feel when they are teething, with their teeth just starting to grow, and they feel an itching and a soreness in their gums. So the soul, as it grows its wings, seethes and feels sore and tingles. 'When it gazes on the young man's beauty, and receives the particles emanating from it as they approach and flow in\u2014 which, of course, is why we call it desire\u2014it is watered and heated, and it recovers from its pain and is glad. But when it is away from the boy and becomes parched, the dryness makes the mouths of the channels for the budding feathers close up and contain the wings' new growth. The new shoots are shut up inside along with the desire. They throb like pulsing veins, and each one rubs against its channel, with the result that the whole soul stings all over and is frantic with pain\u2014until it remembers the boy in his beauty and is glad. The strange sensation of mingled pain and pleasure is agony for it, and its helplessness torments it. It is too disturbed to sleep at night or stay still by day, and it rushes around to wherever it thinks it might see the boy who bears the beauty it longs for. The sight of him opens the irrigation channels of desire and frees the former blockage; it finds relief and an end to the stinging pain, and once more enjoys this, for the time being, as the most intense pleasure. This is not something it willingly does without, and it values no one more than the beautiful boy. It is oblivious to mothers, brothers, and all its friends. It does not care in the slightest if its wealth suffers through neglect. It despises all the customs and good manners on which it had previously prided itself. Indeed, it is ready to play the part of a slave and to sleep wherever it is allowed to, as long as it is as close as possible to the object of its desire. For as well as worshipping the boy who bears the beauty, it has discovered that he is also the only one who can cure it of its terrible suffering. 'This, you beautiful boy, to whom I am addressing this speech\u2014this is the experience men call love, but you are probably too young to think of what the gods call it as anything but a joke. I think that some Homeric scholars recite two verses from the unpublished poems of Homer which have to do with Love. The second of the two verses is quite outrageous and not very metrical at all. The couplet goes like this: He is the winged one that mortals call \u201cEros\u201d, But since he must grow wings the gods call him \u201cPteros\u201d. You can believe this or not, as you wish. But at any rate the background to and experience of being in love are as I have said. 'Now, if the captive is one of the attendants of Zeus, he can endure the burden of the Winged One with some dignity. But things are different when the servants of Ares, who made the circuitous journey in his company, are captured by Love. If they have the slightest inkling that they have been wronged by their beloved, they become murderous: they are quite ready to immolate both themselves and their beloveds. And so it goes for every single god: as long as he has not yet been corrupted and is living the first of his lives here on earth, an individual spends his life honouring and imitating to the best of his ability the god to whose chorus he belongs, and in all his dealings and relations, including his love-affairs, he conforms to this mode of behavior. So which good-looking boy an individual chooses as his beloved depends on his disposition, and he treats the boy as if he were that very god: he constructs for himself an image, so to speak, and decorates it in order to worship his god and celebrate his rites. 'The followers of Zeus, then, want someone with a Zeus-like soul as their beloved. They look for someone with the potential to be a philosopher and a leader, and when they find him and have fallen in love with him, they do all they can to develop this potential in him. If they have not undertaken such a task before, they set about it now, by learning from any available sources and searching by themselves. In hunting on their own for the nature of their god they are helped by the intense compulsion they are under of gazing on the god. Since they are in contact with the god in their memories, they are inspired by him and, in so far as it is possible for a mortal man to partake of a god, they derive their way of life and the things they do from him. And because they hold their beloved responsible for this, they feel even more affection for him, and as if Zeus were a well from which they draw water, Bacchant-like they pour it over their beloved's soul and make him as similar to their own god as they can. 'Those who were in Hera's company, on the other hand, look for a boy with kingly qualities, and when they find him they behave in exactly the same way with him. And the followers of Apollo and each of the other gods proceed in the same way, in accordance with the nature of their god, and look for a boy for themselves who has the same qualities as themselves. When they find him, they not only imitate the god themselves, but also, by means of persuasion and attunement, they get the boy to conform, as much as he can, to the god's way of life and characteristics. There is no malice or mean-spirited ill-will in their dealings with their beloveds. No, they behave as they do because they are trying their utmost to get the boy completely and utterly to resemble themselves and the god to whom they are dedicated. What true lovers are committed to, the consummation of their quest\u2014at any rate, if they attain their goal in the way I have been describing\u2014thus becomes admirable and a way for someone who is maddened by love to secure the happiness of the object of his affection, if he captures him. 'I will now describe how a captive is caught. Let's stick to the threefold division of the soul we made at the start of this tale, with each and every soul consisting of two horse-like aspects and a third like a charioteer. Now, we said that one of the horses was good and the other bad, but we did not describe the goodness of the good one and the badness of the bad one. We must do so now. The one in the better position has an upright appearance, and is clean-limbed, high-necked, hook-nosed, white in colour, and dark-eyed; his determination to succeed is tempered by self-control and respect for others, which is to say that he is an ally of true glory; and he needs no whip, but is guided only by spoken commands. The other is crooked, over-large, a haphazard jumble of limbs; he has a thick, short neck, and a flat face; he is black in colour, with grey, bloodshot eyes, an ally of excess and affectation, hairy around the ears, hard of hearing, and scarcely to be controlled with a combination of whip and goad. 'So when the charioteer sees the light of his beloved's eyes, his whole soul is suffused with a sensation of heat and he is filled with the tingling and pricking of desire. The horse that is obedient to the charioteer restrains itself from leaping on its beloved, because as always it is held back by a sense of shame. The other horse, however, stops paying any attention to the charioteer's goad and whip; it prances and lunges forward violently, making life extremely difficult for its team-mate and for the charioteer, and compelling them to head towards the beloved and bring up the subject of the pleasures of sex. At first, these two get annoyed at being forced to behave in a way that seems dreadfully wrong, and put up some resistance, but eventually, finding no end to their troubles, they let themselves be led forward, and they passively submit to doing as they are told. And so they come close to their beloved and see the lightning-bright beauty of his face. At this sight the charioteer's memory is taken back to the nature of true beauty, and he sees it again in place on a holy pedestal, next to self-control. The vision terrifies him and he rears back in awe\u2014which inevitably makes him pull back on the reins as well with enough force to set both horses down on their haunches, the one willingly because of its obedience and the unruly one with a great deal of reluctance. 'After the two horses have withdrawn some way back, the good one drenches the whole soul in sweat brought on by its shame and horror, while the other, once it has got over the pain caused by the bit and its fall, scarcely takes time to draw breath before bursting out into furious abuse and hurling curses at both the charioteer and its team-mate for being cowardly and gutless deserters and defaulters. Once more it tries to force them to approach, against their wills, but it reluctantly agrees to their request to wait until later. When the proposed time arrives, it reminds them of their promise, while they both feign forgetfulness, and so, plunging and neighing, it forcibly drags them up to the beloved again in order to make the same suggestion to him as before. As they get close, with head lowered and tail out straight, it bites down on the bit and shamelessly drags them on. But then the same thing happens again to the charioteer, only even more strongly: he recoils as if from a trap and even more violently wrenches the unruly horse's bit back out of its teeth, splashing its curse-laden tongue and jaws with blood, pinning its legs and haunches to the ground, and causing it pain. Once the same thing has happened to it over and over again, the bad horse calms down, and now that it has been humbled it lets itself be guided by the charioteer's intentions. Now, when it sees the good-looking boy, it is frightened to death, and the upshot is that at last the lover's soul follows his beloved in reverence and awe. 'Not only is the boy now being treated as godlike and receiving every kind of service from a man who is not merely pretending to be in love, but does genuinely feel it, but also it is natural for him to feel affection for someone who is treating him so well. As a result, even if previously he had been put off by the assertion of his schoolfriends or whoever that associating with a lover was wrong, and had therefore repelled his lover's advances, yet now, with the passage of time, increasing maturity induces him to allow him into his company, and he is compelled to do so also by necessity, in the sense that it is fated that bad men can never be friends and that good men can never fail to be friends. Once he has allowed him in and has accepted his conversation and company, experience from close at hand of the lover's good will astonishes the beloved and he realizes that the friendship of all his other friends and relatives put together does not amount to even a fraction of the friendship offered by a lover who is inspired by a god. 'When the lover has been doing this for some time, and there has been physical contact between them at meetings in the gymnasium and elsewhere, then at last the flowing stream (which Zeus called \u201cdesire\u201d when he was in love with Ganymede) pours down on the lover in such great quantities that while some of it sinks into him, the rest flows off outside as he fills up and brims over. Just as a gust of wind or an echo rebounds from smooth, hard objects and returns to where it came from, so the flow of beauty returns into the beautiful boy through his eyes, which is its natural route into the soul, and when it arrives and excites him, it irrigates his wings' channels and makes his plumage start to grow, and fills the soul of the beloved in his turn with love. So he is in love, but he has no idea what he is in love with. He does not know what has happened to him and he cannot explain it. It is as if he has caught an inflammation of the eye from someone else and cannot say where it came from; he fails to appreciate that he is seeing himself in his lover as in a mirror. When his lover is with him, he finds just as much relief from his pain as the lover does; when his lover is not there, he misses him just as much and is missed just as much. He has contracted counter-love as a reflection of his lover's love, but he calls it and thinks of it as friendship rather than love. His desires are more or less the same as his lover's, though weaker\u2014to see, touch, kiss, lie down together\u2014and as you might expect before long this is exactly what he does. 'When they lie together, the lover's undisciplined horse makes suggestions to the charioteer and demands a little pleasure to reward it for all its pains. The boy's undisciplined horse has nothing to say, but in its desire and confusion embraces the lover and kisses him. It welcomes him as someone who clearly has its best interests at heart, and when they are lying down together it is inclined not to refuse to play its part in gratifying any request the lover might make. Its team-mate, however, sides with the charioteer and resists this inclination by arguments designed to appeal to its sense of shame. If the better aspects of their minds win and steer them towards orderly conduct and philosophy, they live a wonderful, harmonious life here on earth, a life of self-control and restraint, since they have enslaved the part which allowed evil into the soul and freed the part which allowed goodness in. And when they die, as winged and soaring beings they have won the first of the three truly Olympic bouts, which brings greater benefits than either human sanity or divine madness can supply. 'But if they live a more ordinary life, devoted to prestige rather than philosophy, it is certainly possible, I imagine, that when they are drunk or otherwise in a careless state the two undisciplined horses in them might find their souls undefended and bring them together, and so that they might choose the course which is considered the most wonderful of all by the common run of mankind, and consummate their relationship. Having once done so, they continue with this course of action in the future, but not often, because what they did was not approved by their whole minds. This pair too spend their lives as friends (though not as close friends as the others), not only while they are in love, but also when they have left love behind. They think they have exchanged vows of such enormous strength that it would be wrong for them ever to break them and fall out with each other. At the end of their lives, when they leave their bodies, they may not have any wings, but they do have the desire to gain them, and this is no small prize to have gained from the madness of love. For it is a law that those who have already made a start on the skyward journey shall no longer go into the darkness and enter upon the journey downward to the underworld. Instead, they live a life of brightness and happily travel in each other's company, and sooner or later, thanks to their love, gain their wings together. 'All these are the divine gifts you will gain from the friendship of a lover, young man. But since the companionship of a non-lover is tempered by human sanity, it delivers meagre and mortal rewards. It breeds in the soul of one of its friends a quality of slavishness which is commonly praised as virtue, and so makes it circle mindlessly around and under the earth for nine thousand years. 'There you are, dear god of love. This palinode is my gift to you and my means of atonement. It was as fair and fine as I could make it, especially in its use of poetical language, as insisted on by Phaedrus. Please forgive my earlier speech and look favourably on this one. I pray that you may be gracious and benevolent enough not to get angry and remove or impair the skill in love which you have granted me. Grant that those who are beautiful may value me even more than they already do. If Phaedrus and I said anything in our earlier speech which grated on you, please hold Lysias responsible, as the father of the speech, and make him stop putting words to this kind of use. Instead, have him follow his brother Polemarchus on to the path of philosophy, so that his lover here may no longer be in two minds, as he is now, but may wholeheartedly devote his life to Love and to the language of philosophy.'"]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["Socrates, I too pray that this may happen, if it really is better for Lysias and me. As for your speech, I found it very impressive throughout: it's so much better constructed than your first one. I'm rather worried, then, that Lysias may be humiliated, if he is even prepared to work up another speech to rival yours. The point is, you see, my friend, that just recently a politician was rudely finding fault with him for exactly that, and was using the term 'speech-writer' as a term of abuse throughout. So it may be that concern for his reputation will stop him writing speeches."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Phaedrus, you're making a fool of yourself in saying that.

They were the origin of the race of cicadas, whom the Muses granted the gift of never needing any food once they were born; all they do is sing, from the moment of their births until their deaths, without eating or drinking. After dying they go to the Muses and tell them which men here on earth honoured which of them. They tell Terpsichore the names of those who have honoured her with dances and raise them higher in her favour; they tell Erato the names of those who have honoured her in the ways of love, and so on for all the other Muses, according to each one's area of responsibility. But they tell Calliope, the oldest of the Muses, and her companion Urania about those who spent their lives doing philosophy and honouring their particular kind of music. I should say that these two are the Muses who are especially concerned with the heavens and with the way both gods and men use words, and that there is no more beautiful sound than their voices.

So, 'There are so many types of soul, with such-and-such qualities, which is why some people are like this and others are like that.' After dividing souls up in this way, 'There are so many types of speech, each of such-and-such a kind. People with such-and-such a nature are easy to persuade of such-and-such by speeches of such-and-such a type for reason x, while people with such-and-such a nature are hard to persuade for reason y.' Once our would-be orator has a good intellectual understanding of all this, he should next observe souls actually involved in and being affected by events, using his senses to pay keen attention to them, or else he won't yet be gaining anything from the discussions he heard at school. When he can not only say what kind of person is persuaded by what kind of speech, but also spot that kind of person before him and tell himself that here, in real life and before his eyes, is the kind of person and the kind of character which was the subject of those earlier discussions, and to which such-and-such a kind of speech should be applied in such-and-such a way to persuade him of such-and-such\u2014once he is capable of doing all this, and moreover has understood the proper moments for speaking and for keeping quiet, and can also recognize the appropriate and inappropriate occasions for concision, arousing pity, shocking the audience, and all the various modes of speech he has learnt, then and only then will his expertise have been perfected and completed. But if in his speaking or teaching or writing a person falls short in any of these respects, but still claims to be an expert speaker, the correct response is disbelief.

They say that in the lawcourts no one has the slightest interest in the truth of these things, but only in making a plausible case; and since it is probability that enables one to do that, then this is what someone who plans to be an expert orator should concentrate on. In fact sometimes, they say, you shouldn't even mention what actually happened, if it is improbable, but make up a plausible tale instead, when prosecuting and when defending. Whatever kind of speech one is giving, one should aim for probability (which often means saying farewell to the truth), because rhetorical skill depends entirely on one's speeches being infused throughout by probability."]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["Socrates, that's a perfect account of what the self-professed rhetorical experts say.

The coward will of course not mention his own cowardice, but will try to come up with some other lie, which may give his opponent an opportunity to challenge him. And in every situation professional arguments will look something like that, won't they, Phaedrus?"]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["Of course."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Well, it certainly looks as though it was a wonderfully recondite profession that Tisias discovered\u2014or whoever else it might have been, whatever he likes to be called after.

So we'll listen to you if you have anything else to say about rhetorical expertise, but if you don't we'll trust our recent conclusions. We said that unless a person had enumerated the characters of the members of his audience, and unless he could divide things class by class and take every individual thing, one by one, and see how it falls within a single category, he would never achieve rhetorical expertise to the extent that a human being can. But there's no way that he will ever gain these abilities without a great deal of effort. Now, a sensible person should not expend all that effort in order to speak and act in the world of men, but in order to be able to make speeches that are pleasing to the gods and to act, whatever he is doing, in ways that gratify them, to the limits of his abilities. For as I'm sure you're aware, Tisias, those of us with more than the usual wisdom say that anyone with any sense should not cultivate the gratification of his fellow slaves, except incidentally, but that of his masters, who are thoroughly good. So you shouldn't be surprised if the route is long and circuitous, because the goals for which the journey is undertaken are important, not the trivial ones you suppose. Nevertheless, our argument claims that these trivial goals too will best come about as a result of a person's being prepared to pursue the important ones.'"]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["I think your argument is truly excellent, Socrates \u2014if only one could put it into practice!"]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["But if someone even attempts something fine, whatever happens to him is fine too."]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["All right."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Is this enough on the subject of rhetorical expertise and its lack?"]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["Of course."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["But don't we still have to discuss whether or not writing is desirable\u2014what makes it acceptable and what makes it undesirable?"]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["Yes."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["So do you know the best way for either a theoretical or a practical approach to speech to please god?"]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["No, I don't.

Please tell me what you say you've heard."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["All right. The story I heard is set in Naucratis in Egypt, where there was one of the ancient gods of Egypt\u2014 the one to whom the bird they call the 'ibis' is sacred, whose name is Theuth. This deity was the inventor of number, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy, of games involving draughts and dice\u2014and especially of writing. At the time, the king of the whole of Egypt around the capital city of the inland region (the city the Greeks call 'Egyptian Thebes'), was Thamous, or Amon, as the Greeks call him. Theuth came to Thamous and showed him the branches of expertise he had invented, and suggested that they should be spread throughout Egypt. Thamous asked him what good each one would do, and subjected Theuth's explanations to criticism if he thought he was going wrong and praise if thought he was right. The story goes that Thamous expressed himself at length to Theuth about each of the branches of expertise, both for and against them. It would take a long time to go through all Thamous' views, but when it was the turn of writing, Theuth said, 'Your highness, this science will increase the intelligence of the people of Egypt and improve their memories. For this invention is a potion for memory and intelligence.' But Thamous replied, 'You are most ingenious, Theuth. But one person has the ability to bring branches of expertise into existence, another to assess the extent to which they will harm or benefit those who use them. The loyalty you feel to writing, as its originator, has just led you to tell me the opposite of its true effect. It will atrophy people's memories. Trust in writing will make them remember things by relying on marks made by others, from outside themselves, not on their own inner resources, and so writing will make the things they have learnt disappear from their minds. Your invention is a potion for jogging the memory, not for remembering. You provide your students with the appearance of intelligence, not real intelligence. Because your students will be widely read, though without any contact with a teacher, they will seem to be men of wide knowledge, when they will usually be ignorant. And this spurious appearance of intelligence will make them difficult company.'"]},{character:r.Phaedrus,speech:["Socrates, it doesn't take much for you to make up stories from Egypt and anywhere else in the world you feel like."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Well, my friend, the people at the sanctuary of Zeus at Dodona say that the original prophecies there were spoken by an oak.

The offspring of painting stand there as if alive, but if you ask them a question they maintain an aloof silence. It's the same with written words: you might think they were speaking as if they had some intelligence, but if you want an explanation of any of the things they're saying and you ask them about it, they just go on and on for ever giving the same single piece of information. Once any account has been written down, you find it all over the place, hobnobbing with completely inappropriate people no less than with those who understand it, and completely failing to know who it should and shouldn't talk to.

For the beautiful is dear, being such that it calls [things] to itself and turns [them] towards itself. Hence it is called kalon [sc. 'beautiful'] from the fact that it calls (kalein) lovers to itself. [The next phrase] Where from and where to? is again indicative of the beauty in the sensible [realm], for sensible beauty is always in motion and in [process of] coming to be (genesis) and passing away (phthora). So, since Phaedrus had been excited by the phenomenal beauty that is in speeches, [a beauty] which is observed in [their] motion and flow (for words are the images of thoughts in the soul), and [since] all motion is from somewhere and to somewhere, [Socrates] accordingly asks where from and where to?. Or alternatively, because Socrates made it his business to care for [the welfare of] young men and someone who is going to cure something must first assess its entire condition and only then embark on the treatment, on that account too Socrates inquires what kind of company (sunousiai) he is coming from and what kind he is keen on, in case he has been corrupted by some [of that] company. Since Cephalus is presented to us in the Republic as a person who holds correct opinions (orthodoxastikos) [but lacks true knowledge] and Phaedrus was enamoured of a speech of Lysias, [the words] from Lysias, the son of Cephalus, show that phenomenal beauty is to be grasped by opinion along with sense perception and not by (14) knowledge. I'm going for a walk outside the wall shows that he is about to go to a better and higher life and, as it were, counter to (para) the many. As compared to different things or from different points of view (epibol\xea), the same thing can be understood either as better or as worse. For instance, if for us 'clear' (leukos) means what is manifest (saph\xeas), what can be grasped by the senses and is very easy to make out, 'obscure' (melas) would mean what is not manifest, what is superior to sense-based knowledge, what is deep and able to be grasped only by intellection; but if 'obscure' means what is dark and confused and not manifest (in the sense of being inferior to what is manifest), then 'clear' indicates what is manifest and familiar and the light of the mind and perspicuous. So too with the town or city. Since the many dwell in it, it is clear that in Phaedrus' case I'm going outside the wall stands for '[I'm going] far from the many and the beaten track', that is, 'I'm about to go to a better and higher life', whereas in Socrates' case the city - since [Phaedrus] says later you're just like a visitor being shown the sights (230C7-D1), and you aren't willing to travel or leave the city - indicates that Socrates, or the wise man, always clings to his own roots, or the intelligibles, and never abandons (existasthai) himself. Appropriately, Socrates, the young man's guardian, calls Phaedrus 'dear' from the outset (prooimion). After all, to the extent that hostility or disagreement over behaviour get in the way, the initiator [cannot] initiate nor the initiand be initiated. For how will anyone who has chosen to watch over (pronoein) a person elevate someone he has not felt affection for (philein)? And how will a teacher teach someone with a soul that is not suited to learning? If strife is the opposite of love (philia) and strife is the origin (arkh\xea) of separation, then it is reasonable that love should be [the origin] of union. But union of things that are separate may not occur unless one of them first lays hold of the other - the more active one [laying hold] of the needy one, as fire does of iron, to take a clear example. Thus, here too, Socrates, by having called Phaedrus 'dear', lays hold of him by means of this form of address in order to make him worthy of associating with him. And if there is any need to interpret (anaptussein) the name 'Phaedrus' as well (for the ancients were no worse placed with regard to these matters either) one should be aware that Phaedrus, [who was] in pursuit of phenomenal beauty (for he was a lover of the speeches of Lysias), has learned about the truly real (15) and higher (an\xf4ter\xf4) [kind of beauty] from Socrates. So, [by] focusing on the phenomenal, he unawares lit upon the veiled and intelligible, i.e. hidden and difficult to discern (dioran) (this is what [the name] 'Phaedrus' indicates), and moved from [one kind of] beauty to [another kind of] beauty, so as to be the type of the person who will learn about the beauty that is known by [Socrates]. From this we also learn something else: that because we have a drive (horm\xea) towards the good, an eagerness, a desire [for it], even though we often go wrong on account of appearance (to phainomenon), nevertheless, in [the business of] learning about reality (to on), we are not badly placed with regard to it because our soul already possesses it, even if it was mistaken about the matter (pragma) [in question]. After all, if Phaedrus had not desired beauty, he would not have learned about beauty. [The phrase where to and where from] may seem back to front. There being six kinds of motion, where from [and] where to specify local motion (phora). Now, where from comes first, while where to follows (epagesthai). But one could say (1) from a logical perspective that while motion has where from as its commencement and where to as its termination, the intention of the person who moves has where to as a kind of commencement as it were. After all, unless some other inborn desire is going to move that person to that [destination] he would not start out from where [he is] (enteuthen). [And this is so] not only in the case of living things but even in the case of natural [processes], for we call the movement towards health (hugeia) 'getting well' (hugiansis) and that towards sickness (nosos) 'sickening' (nosansis) because the movements are named from their destinations (telos). And (2) from the ethical point of view [one could say] that Socrates has regard for Phaedrus and says in effect: 'Where are you going? Where have you come from? Y ou've abandoned true beauty, the beauty in divine things, and are marvelling at the beauty in speeches. Look what you've come down to and then you'll recognise where you've come from. For, just as in the case of, let us say, roads and other places (topos), we don't seek out the earlier ones unless we come to the realisation that the later ones are more difficult, in the same way here too, Phaedrus, you cannot learn what you've been snatched away from unless you recognise how far and where you have been taken along (sunelaunein). For your present wrong turning (diamartia), being recent, is capable of carrying [you] back (anagein), by a sort of retrogression, to the condition that truly befits the soul.' And one can also say (3) from the physical perspective (phusik\xf4s) that the second efficient cause after the Demiurge, [i.e.] nature (phusis) (it goes without saying that the divine is the demiurge of nature (16) itself as well [as of everything else]), [when] forming everything from matter, does not first ask what origins matter has had and from what motions [it has originated], but for what purpose it has been endowed with (ekhein) suitability. It is when it is assessed on that basis - according to its rational principles (logos) and formative numbers - that the product is brought to completion. For what if the seed is from good origins and sources (genesis) but isn't itself viable for the [intended] purpose, being faulty in some way? Since, then, Socrates has the status of efficient [cause] and Phaedrus [that] of material [cause], [Socrates] has with reason first investigated [Phaedrus'] fitness for his purpose so that he won't be labouring in vain in the event that there is some obstacle. But he does also pose the question where from [as his] next [priority] (deuter\xf4s). For this too is no small matter. After all a vine could never grow from an olive pit or a bay tree from a grape seed, but each of them grows from its own beginnings (arkh\xea) in accordance with the law (logos) of nature. Having been asked a two-part question the young man has also given a two-part answer. However, on the surface (to phainomenon) he has, in Homeric style, given [his answer] chiastically for clarity's sake, for he has dealt with the 'where from' first, in the manner of [Homer's] 'screams of pain and shouts of triumph, from killers and killed', whereas the [deeper] meaning is that reason also knows that that second [answer], i.e. 'where he is going', is more essential. In any case, it has been dealt with (diat\xearein) later so that he can quietly introduce (hupanoigein) the topics (logos) for their conversation. This is also characteristic of speechwriters, but more so of writers of dialogues and of Plato himself. Or, alternatively: Since the where from has the status of matter and the where to that of form, by adding the where to to the where from he has shown that form brings together and defines matter. And Socrates, because he is exalted and philosophical, has first sought the where to, as being form, while Phaedrus, who is uninitiated (atel\xeas) and still preoccupied with oratory, which makes use of the matters of particular things, has given preference to the where from, as being matter. I am going (227A2): Answers are found to be pretty much (tis) of three kinds. One kind is necessary, one helpful (philanthr\xf4pos), one redundant. For example, [in reply to] 'Where is Dion?, 'He's not here' is the necessary [answer], 'He's not here. He's in the school', the helpful one, 'He's not here. He's in the school to do this or that', the redundant one. In this case, then, where from has received a merely necessary reply, (17) where to one that is also helpful, since he adds for a walk (that is to say, 'walking'; the language is elevated in that it employs a noun (onomastikos), Phaedrus being as it were elevated by [the use of] 'walk', since it is appropriate to a man who has chosen to be sound in both body and mind.) He [sc. Plato] has rejected the redundant [reply] because he [sc. Phaedrus] was not to incur a charge (graphesthai) of garrulity when replying to Socrates. Besides, by this (enteuthen) he is also paving the way for their conversation (sunousia), for the walk is a necessity for their exchange (homilia) [to occur] and a pleasant [interlude] (kharieis), the word [sc. 'walk'] indicating that there is also the need of our choice with regard to beautiful things (ta kala) for the power that produces beauty (kallopoios) to be activated to our benefit. And besides, he has left the from where without a [stated] cause, but sets out the cause of the where to; for since the where to is the goal (telos) of motion in place and the goal is that for the sake of which [something is done], in order that the motion should not seem to be aimless, he sets out the final (telikos) cause. After all, any cause is [a cause] of coming into being rather than of passing away (apoginesthai), and because of this he has left the from where without a [stated] cause, having both intimated the cause of [Phaedrus'] having come to be with Lysias there (kakeise), and thence (kanteuthen) simultaneously also intimated that of his leaving (apoginesthai). For by saying from Lysias, of Cephalus (that is to say, 'son of', for that is the meaning in Attic even without the article) and [thereby] introducing the orator, he has shown both [that] he came to him for the sake of rhetorical instruction and [that] he left him for the sake of relaxation."},{turn:1,phrase:1,comment:"'I spent a long time' and 'sitting' indicate that dallying (stroph\xea) among material things and spending time on phenomenal beauty is onerous and irksome.

They do their praising so splendidly that they cast a spell over our souls, attributing to each individual man, with the most varied and beautiful verbal embellishments, both praise he merits and praise he does not, extolling the city in every way, and praising the war-dead, all our ancestors before us, and us ourselves, the living.

Now we must render them in words the remaining recognition that the law appoints for them and duty demands. For when deeds have been bravely done, it is through an eloquent speech that remembrance and honor accrue to their doers from the hearers. Clearly, what is required is a speech that will praise the dead as they deserve but also gently admonish the living, urging their sons and brothers to imitate the valor of these men, and consoling their fathers, their mothers and any of their grandparents who may remain alive.','\n\t"Well then, what speech on our part would display that effect? Where would it be right for us to begin our praise of brave men, who in their lives gladdened their families and friends through their valor and by their death purchased safety for their survivors? I think it appropriate to present their praises in an order the same as that in which they became brave\u2014the order of nature: they became brave by being sons of brave fathers. Let us, therefore, extoll first their noble birth, second their rearing and education. After that, let us put on view the deeds they performed, showing that they were noble and worthy of their birth and upbringing.',"\n\t\"The nobility of these men's origin is rooted in that of their ancestors. The latter were not immigrants and did not, by arriving from elsewhere, make these descendants of theirs live as aliens in the land, but made them children of the soil, really dwelling and having their being in their ancestral home, nourished not, as other peoples are, by a stepmother, but by a mother, the land in which they lived. Now they lie in death among the familiar places of her who gave them birth, suckled them, and received them as her own. Surely it is most just to celebrate the mother herself first; in this way the noble birth of these men is celebrated at the same time.",'\n\t"Our land is indeed worthy of being praised not merely by us but by all of humanity. There are many reasons for that, but the first and greatest is that she has the good fortune to be dear to the gods. The quarrel of the gods who disputed over her and the verdict that settled it bear witness to what we say. How could it not be just for all humankind to praise a land praised by the gods? The second commendation that is due her is that in the age when the whole earth was causing creatures of all kinds\u2014wild animals and domestic livestock\u2014to spring up and thrive, our land showed herself to be barren of savage beasts and pure. Out of all the animals she selected and brought forth the human, the one creature that towers over the others in understanding and alone acknowledges justice and the gods.',"\n\t\"The fact that everything that gives birth is supplied with the food its offspring needs is weighty testimony for this assertion that the earth hereabouts gave birth to these men's ancestors and ours. For by this sign it can be seen clearly whether or not a woman has really given birth: she is foisting off an infant not her own, if she does not have within her the wellsprings of its nourishment. The earth here, our mother, offers precisely this as sufficient testimony that she has brought forth humans. She first and she alone in that olden time bore food fit for humans, wheat and barley, which are the finest and best nourishment for the human race, because she really was the mother of this creature. And such testimonies are to be taken more seriously on earth's behalf than a woman's, inasmuch as earth does not mimic woman in conceiving and generating, but woman earth.",'\n\t"She was not miserly with this grain; she dispensed it to others too. Later she brought olive oil to birth for her children, succor against toil. And when she had nourished them and brought them to their youthful prime, she introduced the gods to rule and teach them. They (it is fitting to omit their names on an occasion like this: we know them) equipped us for living, by instructing us, earlier than other peoples, in arts for meeting our daily needs, and by teaching us how to obtain and use arms for the defense of the land.','\n\t"With the birth and education I have described, the ancestors of these men lived under a polity that they had made for themselves, of which it is right to make brief mention. For a polity molds its people; a goodly one molds good men, the opposite bad. Therefore I must show that our ancestors were molded in a goodly polity, thanks to which both they and the present generation\u2014among them these men who have died\u2014are good men. For the polity was the same then and now, an aristocracy; we are now governed by the best men and, in the main, always have been since that remote age. One man calls our polity democracy, another some other name that pleases him; in reality, it is government by the best men along with popular consent. We have always had kings; at one time they were hereditary, later elected. Yet in most respects the people have sovereign power in the city; they grant public offices and power to those who are thought best by them at a given time, and no one is excluded because of weakness or poverty or obscurity of birth, nor is anyone granted honors because of the corresponding advantages, as happens in other cities. There is, rather, one standard: he who is thought wise or good exercises power and holds office.',"\n\t\"The reason we have this polity is our equality in birth. The other cities have been put together from people of diverse origin and unequal condition, so that their polities also are unequal\u2014tyrannies and oligarchies. Some of their inhabitants look on the others as slaves, while the latter look on the former as masters. We and our fellows-citizens, all brothers sprung from one mother, do not think it right to be each other's slaves or masters. Equality of birth in the natural order makes us seek equality of rights in the legal and defer to each other only in the name of reputation for goodness and wisdom.",'\n\t"Because of this splendid polity of ours, the fathers of these men\u2014our fathers\u2014and the men themselves, brought up in complete freedom and well-born as they were, were able to display before all humanity, in both the private and the public spheres, many splendid deeds. They thought that they were obliged to fight on the side of freedom both for Greeks against Greeks and against barbarians for Greece as a whole. My time is too brief to narrate as the matter deserves how they defended their country against Eumolpus and the Amazons and even earlier invaders, or how they defended the Argives against the Cadmeans and the sons of Heracles against the Argives. Besides, poets have already hymned the valorous exploits of the ancients in splendid song and made them known to all; so if we should try to elaborate the same subjects in prose, we would perhaps finish a clear second.','\n\t"I think it best to pass those deeds by for that reason as well as because they already have a reward worthy of them. But in regard to deeds for which no poet has yet received glory worthy of worthy themes, and which remain in virgin state\u2014those I think I ought to mention with praise and woo out of seclusion for others to put into choral odes and poems of other kinds in a manner that befits the men who performed them.',"\n\tHere are the first among the deeds I mean. When the Persians held dominion over Asia and were trying to enslave Europe, the sons of this land checked them\u2014our fathers, whose valor it is both right and necessary to mention first in praise. Clearly one who is to praise it well must contemplate it after he has, in thought, been transported into that time when the whole of Asia was already subject to a third Persian king. Cyrus, the first of them, when by his keen spirit he liberated his fellow citizens, the Persians, enslaved the Medes, their masters, at the same time and became lord over the rest of Asia as far as Egypt; his son over as much of Egypt and Libya as it was possible to penetrate. Darius, third of the line, with his land forces set the bounds of his sway as far as Scythia, and with his ships gained so much control over the sea and its islands that no one presumed to oppose him. The minds of all humankind were in bondage: so many, such great and warlike, peoples had the realm of Persia enslaved.",'\n\t"Now Darius denounced us and the Eretrians. On the pretext that we had plotted against Sardis he dispatched five hundred thousand men in transport and combat ships, with three hundred ships of war, and ordered Datis, their commander, to come back with the Athenians and Eretrians in tow if he wanted to keep his head on his shoulders.',"\n\t\"Datis sailed to Eretria, against men who were the most highly esteemed in warfare of the Greeks of that time and were quite numerous besides. He overpowered them in three days. He also scoured their whole country to keep anyone from escaping. This he accomplished in the following way: his soldiers proceeded to the border of Eretria's territory and posted themselves at intervals from sea to sea; they then joined hands and passed through the entire country, so that they would be able to tell the king that no one had escaped them.",'\n\t"Datis and his force left Eretria and came ashore at Marathon with the same intention, confident that it would be easy for them to force the Athenians under the same yoke as they had the Eretrians and lead them captive too. Even though the first of these operations had been accomplished and the second was underway, none of the Greeks came to aid either the Eretrians or the Athenians except the Lacedaemonians\u2014and they arrived on the day after the battle. All the others were panic-stricken and lay low, cherishing their momentary safety.','\n\t"By being transported into that situation, I say, one might realize just how great the valor really was of those men who withstood the might of the barbarians at Marathon, chastened the arrogance of all Asia, and were first to erect a trophy over the barbarians. They showed the way and taught the rest that Persian power is not invincible and that there is no multitude of men and mass of money that does not give way to valor. I declare that those men were fathers not only of our bodies but of our freedom, ours and that of everyone on this continent. For it was with eyes on that deed that the Greeks dared to risk the battles for their deliverance that followed\u2014pupils of the men who fought at Marathon.','\n\t"So the highest rank in honor must be assigned to them by my speech, but the second to the men who fought and won at sea off Salamis and at Artemisium. For one could give a lengthy account of those men, too\u2014the kind of assaults they withstood on land and sea, and how they fought them off. But I shall mention what I think is their finest achievement: they accomplished the successor to the task accomplished at Marathon. The men there showed the Greeks only that a few of them could fight off many barbarians by land; by sea there was still doubt, and the Persians had a reputation for invinciblity because of their numbers, wealth, skill, and strength. This in particular is what merits praise in the men who fought the sea battles of those times: they freed the Greeks from this second terror and made them stop fearing preponderance in ships and men. So it turns out that the other Greeks were educated by both\u2014by those who fought at Marathon and those who took part in the naval battle at Salamis: as pupils of the former by land and the latter by sea, they lost their habit of fearing the barbarians.','\n\t"And of the exploits for the deliverance of Greece that at Plataea was, I maintain, the third, both in number and in valor\u2014at last an effort shared by both the Lacedaemonians and the Athenians.','\n\t"So all the men in those battles fought off a very great and formidable danger. They are being eulogized for their valor now by us, and will be eulogized in the future by posterity. Afterwards, though, many Greek cities were still subject to the barbarian, and it was reported that the king himself had a new attempt on the Greeks in mind. Therefore, it is right for us to mention those, too, who, by cleansing the sea and driving from it the entire barbarian force, brought to completion what their predecessors had done for our deliverance. These were the men who fought in the naval battle at Eurymedon, those who made the expedition to Cyprus, and those who sailed to Egypt and many other places. They must be mentioned with gratitude, because they instilled fear in the king and forced him to ponder his own safety rather than plot the destruction of the Greeks.','\n\t"Well, this war against the barbarians was endured to the end by the whole city in defense of ourselves and our fellow speakers of Greek. But when peace prevailed and the city was held in honor, there came upon her what people generally inflict on the successful: jealousy and\u2014through jealousy\u2014ill-will. And that involved her, reluctantly, in fighting against Greeks. When war had broken out, the Athenians did battle with the Lacedaemonians at Tanagra for the freedom of the Boeotians, and although the issue of the battle was unclear, the action that followed was decisive. For the Lacedaemonians withdrew and abandoned those whom they had come to aid, but our men were victorious at Oenophyta two days later and justly restored those who were unjustly in exile. They were the first after the Persian War to fight for the freedom of Greeks in the new way\u2014against Greeks; and since they proved to be brave men and liberated those to whose aid they came, they were the first to be buried in this tomb with civic honors.','\n\t"Later, when a great war had broken out, and all the Greeks attacked our city, ravaged her land, and made sorry recompense for the services she had done them, our countrymen, who had been victorious over them at sea and had captured their Lacedaemonian leaders on Sphacteria, spared the latter, sent them home, and made peace, even though they could have killed them. They thought that against men of their own race it is right to make war as far as victory rather than bring the common interests of Greece to ruin through resentment against one city, but against the barbarians it is right to make total war. The men who fought in that war and now lie here deserve praise, because they showed that if anyone maintained that in the former war, the one against the barbarians, any other people were braver than the Athenians, that was not true. By prevailing when Greece was in discord, by getting the better of the foremost among the other Greeks, they showed on this occasion that they could conquer by themselves those with whom they had once conquered the barbarians in a common effort.','\n\t"After this peace a third war broke out\u2014a war that defied all expectations and was terrible. Many brave men who died in it lie here. Many fell on Sicilian shores after they had set up a great many trophies in battles for the freedom of the people of Leontini. Bound by oaths, they had sailed to those parts to defend them, but when their city found herself thwarted on account of the length of the voyage and could not reinforce them, they gave out and came to grief. Their enemies, even though they fought on the other side, have more praise for their self-control and valor than have the friends of other men. Many fell, too, in naval battles on the Hellespont, after capturing all the enemy ships in one engagement, and coming off victorious in many others.','\n\t"As for my saying that the war was terrible and defied all expectations, what I mean is that the other Greeks arrived at such a pitch of jealous rivalry against our city that they brought themselves to send an embassy to their worst enemy, the king, whom they had as our allies expelled in a common effort, to bring him back on their own, a barbarian against Greeks, and to muster everyone, Greeks and barbarians, against our city.','\n\t"And at just that point her strength and valor shone bright. For when her enemies supposed that she was already beaten, and when her ships were blockaded at Mytilene, the citizens themselves embarked and went to the rescue with sixty ships. After they had, as everyone agrees, behaved most heroically in overcoming their enemies and rescuing their friends, they met with undeserved calamity: their dead were not picked up from the sea and do not lie here. We ought to remember and praise those men forever, because by their valor we won not only that naval engagement, but also the rest of the war. For it was through them that the opinion gained currency that our city could never be defeated in war, not even by all mankind. And that belief was true. We were overcome by our own quarrels, not by other men; by them we remain undefeated to this day, but we conquered ourselves and suffered defeat at our own hands.','\n\t"Afterwards, when tranquillity reigned and we were at peace with our neighbors, there was civil war among us, fought in such a way that, if people had to engage in internal strife, no one would pray for his city to be stricken in any other. So readily and naturally\u2014so much contrary to the expectations of the other Greeks\u2014did the citizens from the Piraeus and those from the city deal with each other! So moderately did they bring the war against the men at Eleusis to a conclusion!',"\n\t\"And the sole cause for all that was their genuine kinship, which provided them, not in word but in fact, with a firm friendship based on ties of blood. We must also remember those who died at each other's hands in that war and try to reconcile them in ceremonies such as today's by what means we have\u2014prayers and sacrifices\u2014praying to the gods below who have power over them, since we ourselves are reconciled as well. For they did not lay hands on each other through wickedness or enmity, but through misfortune. And we, the living, are witnesses of this ourselves, since we, who are of the same stock, have forgiven each other for what we did and for what we suffered.",'\n\t"After that we got general peace, and the city enjoyed tranquillity. She forgave the barbarians; she had done them harm, and they gave as good as they got. But the Greeks aroused her indignation, because she recalled the thanks they had returned for the good she had done them\u2014by making common cause with the barbarians, stripping her of the ships that had once been their salvation, and dismantling walls once sacrificed by us to keep theirs from falling. The city formed a policy of no longer protecting Greeks from being enslaved, either by each other or by barbarians, and conducted herself accordingly. So, since this was our policy, the Lacedaemonians, thinking that we, the champions of freedom, had fallen and all they had to do now was enslave the other Greeks, set about that very task.',"\n\t\"And why should I prolong the tale? From here on I wouldn't be speaking of things that happened in the past to former generations. We ourselves know how the foremost among the Greeks\u2014the Argives and the Boeotians and Corinthians\u2014came, in a state of panic, to feel a need for our city, and\u2014wonder of wonders!\u2014even the king reached such a point of perplexity that his deliverance came full circle to arising from nowhere other than this city, which he had kept zealously trying to destroy.","\n\t\"In fact, if one should wish to lay a just charge against our city, one would rightly blame her only by saying that she is always too compassionate and solicitous of the underdog. And during this time in particular, she was not able to persevere and stick to the policy she had decided on\u2014namely, to aid against enslavement none of the cities that had treated her people unfairly. On the contrary, she relented, came to the rescue, and released the Greeks from slavery by coming to their aid herself, with the result that they remained free until they once more enslaved themselves. On the other hand\u2014out of respect for the trophies at Marathon and Salamis and Plataea\u2014she could not stomach aiding the king in person; but merely by allowing exiles and mercenaries to assist him, she was, by common consent, his salvation. And after she had rebuilt her walls and fleet, she took the war upon herself, when she was forced to do so, and fought with the Lacedaemonians in the Parians' behalf.",'\n\t"The king came to fear our city, when he saw that the Lacedaemonians were giving up the war at sea. Out of a wish to disengage himself, he demanded, as his price for continuing to fight on our side and that of the other allies, the Greeks on the Asian mainland whom the Lacedaemonians had previously made over to him. He did so because he believed that we would refuse and give him an excuse for disengaging. He was mistaken about the other allies; the Corinthians, the Argives, the Boeotians, and the rest were willing to hand them over to him and made a sworn treaty on terms that if he would give them money, they would hand over the Greeks on the mainland. We alone could not bring ourselves to betray them or swear the oath. That is how firm and sound the high-mindedness and liberality of our city are, how much we are naturally inclined to hate the barbarians, through being purely Greek with no barbarian taint. For people who are barbarians by birth but Greeks by law\u2014offspring of Pelops, Cadmus, Aegyptus, Danaus and many others\u2014do not dwell among us. We dwell apart\u2014Greeks, not semibarbarians. Consequently, our city is imbued with undiluted hatred of foreignness.','\n\t"For all that, we found ourselves once again isolated, because we refused to commit a shameful and sacrilegious deed by betraying Greeks to barbarians. So we arrived in the same circumstances that had led to our defeat before, but this time, with divine help, we managed the war better: we disengaged ourselves while still in possession of our ships, walls, and colonies. That is how glad the enemy, too, were to make peace! But we lost brave men in this war also, victims of rough terrain at Corinth and treason at Lechaeum. Brave, too, were those who extricated the king from his difficulties and banished the Lacedaemonians from the sea. I remind you of those men, and it is fitting for you to praise them with me and do them honor.','\n\t"And these, in truth, were the deeds of the men who lie here and of others who have died for Athens. Many fine words have been spoken about them, but those that remain unsaid are a great deal more numerous and finer still; many days and nights would not suffice for one who sets out to complete the enumeration. Therefore we must remember the fallen, and every man, just as in war, must encourage their descendants not to desert the ranks of their ancestors and not to yield to cowardice and fall back. So then, I myself both so encourage you today, sons of brave men, and in the future, whenever I meet any of you, I will remind you and exhort you to do your utmost to be as brave as can be.','\n\t"On this occasion, though, it is my duty to repeat the words that our fathers commanded us to report to those left at home every time they were about to put their lives at risk, in case they lost them. I will tell you what I heard from them and what\u2014judging by what they said then\u2014they would gladly say to you now, if only they could. Whatever I report you must imagine you are hearing from them in person. And this is what they said:',"\n\n\t\"'Sons, the present circumstance itself reveals that you are sprung from brave fathers. Free to live on ignobly, we prefer to die nobly rather than subject you and your descendants to reproach and bring disgrace on our fathers and all our ancestors. We consider the life of one who has brought disgrace on his own family no life, and we think that no one, human being or god, is his friend, either on the earth or beneath it after his death.","\n\t\"'Therefore, you must remember what we say and do whatever you do to the accompaniment of valor, knowing that without it all possessions and all ways of life are shameful and base. For neither does wealth confer distinction on one who possesses it with cowardice (the riches of a man like that belong to another, not himself) nor do bodily beauty and strength, when they reside in a worthless and cowardly man, seem to suit him. On the contrary, they seem out of character; they show up the one who has them for what he is and reveal his cowardice. Moreover, all knowledge cut off from rectitude and the rest of virtue has the look of low cunning, not wisdom.","\n\t\"'For these reasons, make it your business from beginning to end to do your absolute utmost always in every way to surpass us and our ancestors in glory. If you do not, be sure that if we excel you in valor, our victory, as we see it, brings us shame, but if we are excelled by you, our defeat brings happiness. And the surest way to bring about our defeat and your victory would be if you would prepare yourselves not to abuse and waste the good repute of your ancestors, because you are aware that for a man with self-respect nothing is more disgraceful than to make himself honored not through himself, but through his ancestors' glory. Honors that come from ancestors are a noble and magnificent treasure for their descendants, but it is shameful and unmanly to enjoy the use of a treasure of wealth and honors and fail to hand it on to the following generation because of a lack of acquisitions and public recognition on one's own part. And if you will live as we advise you to live, you will come to us as friends to friends, when your destiny conveys you here; but if you have neglected our advice and behaved as cowards, no one will welcome you. So ends what is to be reported to our sons.","\n\t\"'And as for those of our fathers and mothers who still live, one ought ceaselessly to encourage them to bear the sorrow, should it fall to their lot, as easily as they can, instead of joining them in lamentations. For they will stand in no need of a stimulus for grief; the misfortune that has befallen them will be enough to provide that. A better course is to try to heal and soothe them, by reminding them that the gods have answered their most earnest prayers. For they prayed for their sons to live not forever, but bravely and gloriously. And that\u2014the greatest of boons\u2014is what they received. It is not easy for a mortal to have everything in his life turn out as he would have it.","\n\t\"'If they bear their sorrows courageously, they will seem to be really fathers of courageous sons\u2014and just as courageous themselves; but if they succumb to grief, they will provide grounds for suspicion that either they are not our fathers or the people who praise us are mistaken. Neither of these must happen. On the contrary, they above all must be our encomiasts in action, by showing themselves to be true men, with the look of truly being the fathers of true men. Nothing too much has long been thought an excellent adage\u2014because it is, in truth, excellent. For that man's life is best arranged for whom all, or nearly all, the things that promote happiness depend on himself. Such a man does not hang from other men and necessarily rise or fall in fortune as they fare well or badly; he is the temperate, he is the brave and wise man. He above all, when wealth and children come and when they go, will pay heed to the adage: because he relies on himself, he will be seen neither to rejoice nor to grieve too much.","\n\t\"'That is the sort of men we expect our fathers to be, the sort we wish them to be, and the sort we say they are. It is, moreover, how we now comport ourselves\u2014neither too much vexed nor too fearful if the time of our death is upon us. And we beg our fathers and mothers to pass the rest of their lives with these same sentiments. We want them to know that they will give us no special pleasure by singing dirges and wailing over us. On the contrary, if there is among the dead any perception of the living, that is how they would most displease us\u2014by doing themselves injuries and bearing their sorrows heavily. They would please us most by bearing them lightly and with moderation. By that time our lives will have come to the conclusion that is noblest for human beings, so that it is more fitting to celebrate them than to lament them. But by caring for our wives and children and nourishing them, and by turning their minds to the concerns of the living, they would most readily forget their troubles and live more nobly, more uprightly, and more in harmony with our wishes.","\n\t\"'That is enough to report from us to our parents. As for the city\u2014we would exhort her to care for our parents and children, educating the latter decently and cherishing the former in their old age as they deserve, if we did not, in fact, know that she will care for them well enough with no exhortation from us.'","\n\n\t\"Children and parents, the dead commanded me to report those words, and I report them with all my heart. And on my own part, in these men's name I beg their sons to imitate them, and I beg their fathers to be confident about themselves, knowing that we will, as individuals and as a community, cherish you in your old age and care for you, anywhere any one of us comes upon any one of you. No doubt you yourselves are aware of the concern shown by the city: she has made laws relating to the families of men who have died in war, and she takes care of their children and parents. More than in the case of other citizens, it is the official duty of the highest magistracy to see to it that their fathers and mothers are protected from injustice. The city herself assists in bringing up their children, eager to keep their orphaned condition as hidden from them as it can be. She assumes the role of father to them while they are still children. When they attain manhood, she decks each of them out in hoplite's armor and sends him out on his life's business, showing him and reminding him of his father's pursuits, by giving him the tools of his father's valor and, at the same time, allowing him, for the sake of the omen, to go for the first time to his ancestral hearth, there to rule in might, arrayed in arms.",'\n\t"The dead themselves she never fails to honor: every year she herself celebrates for all publicly the rites that are celebrated for each in private, and in addition she holds contests in athletic prowess and horsemanship and in music and poetry of every kind. Quite simply, for the dead she stands as son and heir, for their sons as a father, for their parents as a guardian; she takes complete and perpetual responsibility for all of them.','\n\t"With this in mind, you ought to bear your sorrow more patiently; in that way you would best please both the dead and the living and would most easily heal and be healed. And now that you and all the others have, according to the custom, publicly lamented the dead, take your departure.\u201d',"\n\nThere you have it, Menexenus\u2014the speech of Aspasia of Miletus."]},{character:r.Menexenus,speech:["By Zeus, Socrates, your Aspasia is indeed lucky if, woman though she be, she can compose speeches like that one."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["If you doubt it, come to class with me and hear her speak."]},{character:r.Menexenus,speech:["I have often talked with Aspasia, and I know what she is like, Socrates."]},{character:r.Socrates,speech:["Well then, don't you admire her and aren't you grateful to her for her speech now?"]},{character:r.Menexenus,speech:["Yes, Socrates, I'm very grateful for that speech\u2014to her or whoever it was who recited it to you.
