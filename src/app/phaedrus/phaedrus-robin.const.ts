He claims, you see, that you should gratify someone who is not in love with you rather than someone who is.`,

If only he would write a speech about how you should gratify a poor man rather than a rich one, an elderly man rather than a young one, and so on for all the other attributes which I and most of us have! Then his speeches would really be sociable and would serve the com- mon good. Anyway, I’m so keen to hear it that I’ll keep up with you even if you walk to Megara––up to the wall there and back again, as Herodicus recommends.`,

      `I tell you, Phaedrus, if I don’t know Phaedrus, I’m a stranger to myself too. But neither of these is the case. I’m sure that once he had heard Lysias’ speech he didn’t hear it just once. No, he nagged him to read it again and again–– and I’m sure that Lysias was very happy to comply. And I doubt that even this was enough for Phaedrus. Eventually he borrowed the scroll himself and pored over those parts of the speech he particularly wanted to look at, and continued with this, sitting in his place from daybreak onwards, until he got tired and went for a walk, by which time, I would say ––yes, by the dog,* I would!––he knew the speech by heart, unless it was really quite long. And so he went for a walk outside the city walls to rehearse the speech. Then he came across someone who is sick with passion for hearing speeches.* When he saw him . . . well, when he saw him he was delighted to find someone with whom he could share his frenzy, so he told him to lead the way. But when this speech-lover asked him to repeat the speech, he coyly pretended that he didn’t want to, even though he was even- tually going to repeat it even if he had to force it on an unwilling audience.* So, Phaedrus, why don’t you ask him right here and now to do what he’s soon going to do anyway?`,

      `It wouldn’t be odd for me to doubt it as the experts do. I might give a clever explanation of it, and say that a gust of wind from the north pushed her from the nearby rocks while she was playing with Pharmaceia, and although this caused her death she was said to have been abducted by Boreas––either from here or from the Areopa- gus,* since there’s another version of the story, that she was abducted from there, not here. Basically, Phaedrus, although I find these kinds of interpretations fascinating, they are the work of someone who is too clever for his own good. He has to work hard and is rather unfortunate, if only because he next has to correct the way Centaurs look, and then the Chimaera, and then there pours down on him a horde of similar creatures, like the Gorgon and Pegasus and count- less other extraordinary beasts with all kinds of monstrous natures.*† If anyone has doubts about these creatures and wants to use a rough-and-ready kind of ingenuity to force each of them to conform with probability, he’ll need a lot of spare time. As for me, I never have time to spend on these things, and there’s a good reason for this, my friend: I am still incapable of obeying the Delphic inscription and know- ing myself.* It strikes me as absurd to look into matters that have nothing to do with me as long as I’m still ignorant in this respect, so I ignore all these matters and go along with the traditional views about them. As I said just now, I investigate myself rather than these things, to see whether I am in fact a creature of more complexity and savagery than Typhon, or something tamer and more simple, with a naturally divine and non-Typhonic nature. But anyway, my friend, if I may interrupt our conversation, isn’t this the tree you were taking us to?`,

      `By Hera, what a lovely secluded spot! This plane tree is very tall and flourishing, the agnus is tall enough to provide excellent shade too, and since it is in full bloom it will probably make the place especially fragrant. Then again, the stream flowing under the plane tree is particularly charming, and its water is very cold, to judge by my foot. The place seems by the statuettes and figures* to be sacred to certain of the Nymphs and to Achelous. Or again, if you like, how pleasant and utterly delightful is the freshness c of the air here! The whisper of the breeze chimes in a summery, clear way with the chorus of the cicadas. But the nicest thing of all is the fact that the grass is on a gentle slope which is perfect for resting one’s head on when lying down. You are indeed a very good guide, my dear Phaedrus.`,

Just as people get hungry animals to follow them by waving some greenery or a vegetable in front of them, so it looks as though all you have to do is dangle a speech on a scroll in front of me and you can take me all over Attica, and any- e where else you fancy. At the moment, though, this is the place I’ve come to, and so I think I’ll lie down, and you can find whatever position you think will be most comfortable for reading, and then read.`,
