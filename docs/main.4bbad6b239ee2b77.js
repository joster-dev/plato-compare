requesting you to come and see it with us.","However, we will tell you now; for we think we should speak our minds freely to friends like you.","Some people, of course, pour ridicule on such appeals, and when consulted for their advice will not say what they think, but something different, making the inquirer's wishes their aim, and speaking against their own judgement.","But you, we consider, not merely have the necessary discernment but will give us the benefit of it in telling us just what is in your minds;","and hence we have enlisted your counsel on the question which we are about to lay before you.","Now the matter about which I have made all this long preamble is this: we have two sons here,","my friend that one, called Thucydides after his grandfather,","and I this one; he also is named in the same way, after my father; we call him Aristeides.","Well, we have resolved to give them our most constant care, and not\u2014as most fathers do when their boys begin to be young men -let them run loose as their fancy leads them,","but begin forthwith taking every possible care of them.","Now, knowing that you too have sons, we thought that you above all men must have concerned yourselves with the question of the kind of upbringing that would make the best of them;","and if by any chance you have not given your attention to the subject, we would remind you that it ought not to be neglected,","and we invite you to join us in arranging some way of taking care of our sons.\n","How we formed this resolve, Nicias and Laches, is worth hearing, even though the story be somewhat long.","My friend Melesias and I take our meals together, and our boys share our table.","Now, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are going to speak quite freely to you.","Each of us has many noble deeds of his own father to relate to these young fellows \u2014 their numerous achievements both in war and in peace,","when they were managing the affairs either of the allies or of this city;","but neither of us has any deeds of his own to tell.","We cannot help feeling ashamed that our boys should observe this, and we blame our fathers for leaving us to indulge ourselves when we began to be young men, while they looked after other folks' affairs;","and we point the moral of it all to these young people,","telling them that if they are careless of themselves and will not take our advice they will win no reputation,","but if they take due pains they may very likely come to be worthy of the names they bear.","Now they, for their part, say they will do as we bid;","so we are now considering what lessons or pursuits will lead them to the highest attainable excellence.","Someone directed us to this particular accomplishment of fighting in armour, as being an admirable one for a young man to learn;","and he praised that man whose performance you were just watching, and then urged us to go and see him.","So we decided that it would be well to go and see the man ourselves, and to take you along with us not merely as companions at the show, but also as counsellors and co-partners, if you will be so good, in the matter of looking after our sons.","That is the question which we wanted to discuss with you.","And we look to you now, on your part, to give us your advice, first as to whether you think this accomplishment should be learnt or not,","and then as to any other such art or pursuit that you can recommend for a young man;","and also, how you feel inclined as regards our partnership."]},{character:d.Nicias,speech:["For myself, Lysimachus and

ought to let him have it.","And it is only right that you should : for you happen to be our friend through your father ;","he and I were constant companions and friends,","and he died without ever having a single difference with me.","And a certain recollection comes back to me on hearing what has just been said :","for these boys, in talking with each other at home, frequently mention Socrates

let me tell you that I rejoice to hear this and to know you have such a good reputation ;","and you in return must count me as one of your warmest well-wishers.","You ought indeed, on your own part, to have visited us before, and treated us on intimate terms, as you have a right to do :","now, however, that we have discovered each other,","from to-day onwards you must make a point of sharing our thoughts and getting to know us and our young people also,","that you and they may in your turn preserve the friendship of our houses.","That, however, you will do yourself, and we will remind you of it another time :","but what do you say of the matter on which we began to speak?","What is your view?","Is the accomplishment of fighting in armour a suitable one for our boys to learn or not?"]},{character:d.Socrates,speech:["On that matter, Lysimachus, I will do my best to advise you, so far as I can, and also to do all the rest that you so kindly ask.","It seems to me, however, most proper that I, being so much younger and less experienced than you and your friends, should first hear what they have to say, and learn of them ; and then, if I have anything else to suggest as against their remarks, I might try to explain it and persuade you and them to take my view. Come, Nicias, let one or other of you speak."]},{character:d.Nicias,speech:["There is no difficulty about that, Socrates.","For in my opinion this accomplishment is in many ways a useful thing for young men to possess.","It is good for them, instead of spending their time on the ordinary things to which young men usually give their hours of leisure, to spend it on this,","which not only has the necessary effect of improving their bodily health\u2014since it is as good and strenuous as any physical exercise\u2014but","is also a form of exercise which, with riding, is particularly fitting for a free citizen ;","for only the men trained in the use of these warlike implements can claim to be trained in the contest whereof we are athletes and in the affairs wherein we are called upon to contend.","Further, this accomplishment will be of some benefit also in actual battle, when it comes to fighting in line with a number of other men ;","but its greatest advantage will be felt when the ranks are broken, and you find you must fight man to man,","either in pursuing someone who is trying to beat off your attack, or in retreating yourself and beating off the attack of another.","Whoever possessed this accomplishment could come to no harm so long as he had but one to deal with, nor yet, perhaps, if he had several ; it would give him an advantage in any situation.","Moreover, it is a thing which impels one to desire another noble accomplishment ;","for everyone who has learnt how to fight in armour will desire to learn the accomplishment which comes next, the management of troops ;","and when he has got that and once taken a pride in his work he will push on to attain the whole art of generalship.","It is evident already that all accomplishments and pursuits in the military sphere are both honorable and valuable to a man, either in acquisition or in practice ; and this particular one may well be an introduction to them.","And we can make this addition\u2014no slight one\u2014to its claims, that this science will make any man individually a great deal bolder and braver in war.","Nor let us disdain to mention, even though some may think it a rather slight matter,","that it will give him a smarter appearance in the place where a man should look smartest,","and where at the same time he will appear more terrible to the enemy because of his smartness.","So my opinion is, Lysimachus, as I say, that we ought to teach this skill to our young men, and I have told you my reasons for so thinking.","But if Laches has a different view to state, I shall be as glad as anyone to hear it."]},{character:d.Laches,speech:["Well, Nicias, I am loth to say of any sort of accomplishment that it ought not to be learnt ;","for it seems good to know all things.","And besides, if this skill in arms is an accomplishment, as they say who teach it, and as Nicias terms it, it ought to be learnt ;","while if it is not an accomplishment, and those who promise to give it are deceiving us,","or if it is an accomplishment, but not a very important one, what can be the good of learning it?","I speak of it in this way from the following point of view :","I conceive that if there were anything in it, it would not have been overlooked by the Lacedaemonians,","whose only concern in life is to seek out and practice whatever study or pursuit will give them an advantage over others in war.","And if they have overlooked it, at any rate these teachers of it cannot have overlooked the obvious fact that the Lacedaemonians are more intent on such matters than any of the Greeks,","and that anybody who won honour among them for this art would amass great riches elsewhere, just as a tragic poet does who has won honour among us.","And for this reason he who thinks himself a good writer of tragedy does not tour round with his show in a circuit of the outlying Attic towns,","but makes a straight line for this place and exhibits to our people, as one might expect.","But I notice that these fighters in armour regard Lacedaemon as holy ground where none may tread, and do not step on it even with the tips of their toes,","but circle round it and prefer to exhibit to any other people,","especially to those who would themselves admit that they were inferior to many in the arts of war.","Furthermore, Lysimachus, I have come across more than a few of these persons in actual operations, and I can see their quality.","Indeed, we can estimate it offhand : for, as though it were of set purpose, not one of these experts in arms has ever yet distinguished himself in war.","And yet in all the other arts, the men who have made a name are to be found among those who have specially pursued one or other of them ;","while these persons, apparently, stand out from the rest in this particularly hapless fate of their profession.","Why, this man Stesilaus, whom you watched with me in that great crowd as he gave his performance and spoke in those high terms of himself before us,","I have watched elsewhere giving a finer entertainment in the form of a very real display that he made against his will.","The ship on which he was serving struck a transport vessel,","and he was using in the fight a combination of a scythe and a spear\u2014a remarkable weapon that suited so remarkable a man.","Well, the story of this fellow's doings is hardly of enough interest in the main,","but you must hear the upshot of his device of a scythe fixed to a spear.","As he was fighting, it stuck somehow in the other ship's rigging, and held fast ;","so Stesilaus pulled at it in the hope of getting it free, but he could not, and the ships were passing by each other.","For the first moments he ran along in his ship holding on to his spear ;","but as the other ship sheered off from his and drew him after,","still holding the spear, he let it slip through his hand until he gripped the butt-end of the shaft.","From the crew of the transport there came laughter and clapping at his posture,","and when someone aimed a stone at him which hit the deck near his feet, and he let go the spear,","the troops on the warship in their turn could no longer restrain their laughter, as they saw the notable scythe-spear dangling from the transport.","Now, there may perhaps be something in this art of theirs, as Nicias argues,","but at any rate that is my impression of it, in the cases I have met with.","Hence, as I said at the beginning, whether it be an accomplishment, and one of but little use,","or not an accomplishment, but only supposed and pretended to be such, it is not worth the trouble of learning it.","For indeed I hold that if a man who was a coward believed that he possessed it, his only gain would be in rashness,","which would make his true nature the more conspicuous ;","while if he were brave, people would be on the look-out for even the slightest mistake on his part, and he would incur much grievous slander ;","for the pretension to such skill arouses jealousy,","so that unless a man be prodigiously superior to the rest in valour he cannot by any means escape being made a laughing-stock through professing to be so skilled.","Such is my opinion, Lysimachus, of the interest taken in this accomplishment ;","but do as I told you at the beginning ; you are not to let our friend Socrates go,","but must request him to advise us according to his judgement on the matter in hand."]},{character:d.Lysimachus,speech:["Well, I ask it of you, Socrates :","for indeed our members of council, as

and when once he has been led into that, Socrates >vill never let him go until he has thoroughly and properly put all his ways to the test. Now I am accustomed to him, and so I know that one is bound to be thus treated by him, and further, that I myself shall certainly get the same treatment also. For I dehght, Lysimachus, in conversing with the man, and see no harm in our being reminded of any past or present misdoing : nay, one must needs take more careful thought for the rest of one's life, if one does not fly from his words but is mlUng, as Solon said,^ and zealous to learn as long as one hves, \u2022and does not expect to get good sense by the mere arrival of old age. So to me there is nothing unusual, or unpleasant either, in being tried and tested by Socrates ; in fact, I knew pretty well all the time that our argument would not be about the boys if Socrates were present, but about ourselves. Let me therefore repeat that tliere is no objection on my part to holding a debate with Socrates after the fashion that he likes ; but you must see how Laches here feels on the matter."]},{character:d.Laches,speech:['I have but a single mind,^ Nicias, in regard to discussions, or if you hke, a double rather than a single one. For you might think me a lover, and yet also a hater, of discussions : for when I hear a man discussing virtue or any kind of wisdom, one who is truly a man and worthy of his argument, I am exceedingly delighted ; I take the speaker and his speech together, and observe how they sort and harmonize with each other. Such a man is exactly what I understand by " musical,"\u2014he has tuned himself with the fairest harmony, not that of a lyre or other entertaining instrument, but has made a true concord of his own life between his words and his deeds, not in the Ionian, no, nor in the Phrygian nor in the Lydian, but simply in the Dorian mode,- which is the sole Hellenic harmony. Such a man makes me rejoice with his utterance, and anyone would judge me then a lover of discussion, so eagerly do I take in what he says : but a man who shows the opposite character gives me pain, and the better he seems to speak, the more I am pained, with the result, in this case, that I am judged a hater of discussion. Now of Socrates\' words I have no experience, but formerly, I fancy, I have made trial of his deeds ; and there I found him hving up to any fine words however freely spoken. So if he has that gift as well, his wish is mine, and I should be very glad to be cross-examined by such a man, and should not chafe at learning ; but I too agree %vith Solon, while adding just one word to his saying : I should like, as I. grow old, to learn more and more, but only from honest folk. Let him concede to me that my teacher is himself good\u2014else I shall disUke my lessons and be judged a dunce\u2014but if you say that my teacher is to be a younger man, or one who so far has no reputation, or anything of that sort, I care not a jot. I therefore invite you, Socrates, both to teach and to refute me as much as you please, and to learn too what I on my part know ; such is the position you hold in my eyes since that day on which you came through the same danger with me,^ and gave a proof of your own valour which is to be expected of anyone who hopes to justify his good name.

So take my place in inquiring on behalf of the young men ; make out what it is that we want our friends here to tell us, and be our adviser by discussing it with them. For I find that owing to my age I forget the questions I intend to put, and also the answers I receive ; and if the discussion changes in the middle, my memory goes altogether. Do you therefore discuss and elucidate our problem among yourselves ; and I will listen, and then with my friend Melesias I will act at once upon whatever may be your decision."]},{character:d.Socrates,speech:['Let us do, Nicias and Laches, as Lysimachus and Melesias bid us. Now the questions that we attempted to consider a while ago\u2014" Who have been our teachers in this sort of training? What other persons have we made better?" \u2014 are perhaps of a kind on which we might well examine ourselves : but I believe this other way of inquiring leads to the same thing, and will probably also start more from the beginning. For if we happen to know of such and such a thing that by being joined to another thing it makes this thing better, and further, if we are able to get the one joined to the other, we obviously know the thing itself on which we might be consulting as to how it might be best and most easily acquired. Now I daresay you do not grasp my meaning. Well, you will grasp it more easily in this way. If we happen to know that sight joined to eyes makes those eyes the better for it, and further if we are able to get it joined to eyes, we obviously know what this faculty of sight is, on which we might be consulting as to how it might be best and most easily acquired.

spends time where there's some noble study or practice for the young of the sort you seek."]},{character:d.Lysimachus,speech:["How do you mean, Laches?","Socrates here is concerned for things of this sort?"]},{character:d.Laches,speech:["Very much so, Lysimachus."]},{character:d.Nicias,speech:["And I can state this as strongly as Laches.","In fact, just recently he recommended a music teacher for my son-Damon, a pupil of Agathocles,","who's quite accomplished not only in music","but in everything else worth spending time on for young men of that age."]},{character:d.Lysimachus,speech:["People my own age hardly get to know the younger generation anymore, Socrates and Nicias and Laches:","we spend so much time at home due to old age.","But if you can offer any good counsel to these fellow demesmen of yours, son of Sophroniscus, you must do so.","You ought to, for actually you're our friend through your father.","Your father and I were ever two friends and comrades,","and he died before we ever disagreed in anything.","A memory came back to me just now as we were speaking:","these young men here talk with one another at home and often mention Socrates and praise him highly.","I never thought to ask if they meant the son of Sophroniscus.","Well, tell me, boys, is this the Socrates you've mentioned so often?"]},{character:d.LysimachusSon,speech:["Certainly that's him, father."]},{character:d.Lysimachus,speech:["I'm delighted you're such a credit to your father, Socrates, because he was the best of men,","and especially because your own concerns will be ours and ours yours."]},{character:d.Laches,speech:["Yes, Lysimachus, you really mustn't let go of the man,","because I saw him in another place do honor not only to his father but to his fatherland.","He was with me on the retreat from Delium,","and I tell you that if the rest had only been like him,","our city would have stood upright and not taken such a fall."]},{character:d.Lysimachus,speech:["Socrates, this is high praise indeed.","You're praised now by men to be relied on in these matters.","Rest assured then that I'm delighted to hear you're held in such high regard,","and consider me among those most kindly disposed to you.","Well, you should have visited us before and counted us your kindred, as is right;","but from this day on, now that we've found each other,","you must share our thoughts and get to know us and these young men here,","so that you and they may also preserve the friendship of our houses.","You'll do this, then, and we in turn will remind you.","But what do you say about the subject with which we began?","What do you think?","Is this study, learning to fight in armor, suitable for young men or not?"]},{character:d.Socrates,speech:["Why, I'll try to give the best advice I can, Lysimachus, and to do all you ask.","But since I'm younger than these gentlemen (Socrates indicates Nicias and Laches) and less experienced, I think it very right for me first to hear what they have to say and to learn from them. If I have anything to add, I'll at that point teach and persuade both you and them. But Nicias, why doesn't one of you begin?"]},{character:d.Nicias,speech:["Nothing prevents it, Socrates.","Indeed, I think this study is beneficial to young men in many ways.","For one thing, it's good for them not to spend time elsewhere on the things young men like when they're at leisure, but on this instead;","the body necessarily improves from it, for it's in no way inferior to other bodily exercise, or less strenuous.","And at the same time this exercise and horsemanship especially befit a free man.","For we are athletes in a contest, and in the matters in which we contend, only those are exercised who are exercised in the tools of war.","Then too, this study will also be a benefit in combat when one might fight in ranks with many others,","but its greatest benefit is when ranks are broken and single combat is required,","either pursuing someone warding off attack or warding off attack when retreating oneself.","A man who knew this would not suffer at the hands of a single opponent, and perhaps not even of many, but everywhere gain the advantage.","Again, this sort of thing calls forth desire for another excellent study:","anyone who learns to fight in armor would want to go on next to the study of tactics, the ordering of men in ranks,","and once he grasps this and his ambition is stirred, he'll be eager for all that pertains to strategy, the art of the general.","It's already clear that every study and practice involved in these subjects is noble and of great value for a man to study and practice, for which this study might serve as introduction.","I'll add-and it's no small addition-that this knowledge would make any man more confident and courageous in war, and by no small amount.","Nor let us disdain to say, even if one thinks it less important,","that it will also make him more graceful where a man should appear more graceful,","and in a place where at the same time he will appear more terrible to his enemies by reason of his gracefulness.","So for my part, Lysimachus, as I say, I think it should be taught to the lads, and I've said why I think so.","But if Laches has something contrary to say, I'd myself gladly listen."]},{character:d.Laches,speech:["Why Nicias, it's hard to say of any study whatever that it shouldn't be learned,","because it seems good to know everything,","and in particular this skill in arms, if it's really the subject of study its teachers claim and Nicias says;","but if it's not a subject of study and those who profess it are practicing a deception,","or if it is a subject of study but not a very serious one, why learn it?","I say this with a view to the following:","I think if it amounted to anything, the Spartans would not have ignored it;","nothing else matters in life to them except to seek and practice whatever once learned and practiced gives them advantage over others in war.","If they've ignored it, that very fact is something at least these teachers of it have not ignored, namely, that the Spartans are in earnest about this sort of thing beyond all other Greeks,","and that anyone honored by them in it would make much more money from the rest, as tragic poets do when honored by us.","That's why anybody who thinks he's good at producing tragedy doesn't go on circuit outside the walls, putting on performances in other cities around Attica,","but brings his work straight here and performs for this audience-reasonably enough.","But, I see, these people who fight in armor believe Sparta is sacred and forbidden ground, not to be trod on even tip-toe;","they skirt it and put on a show for everyone else instead,","especially those who'd even themselves agree they have many superiors in warfare.","Then again, Lysimachus, I've met quite a few of these fellows in the work itself, and I see what they are.","Indeed, we can look at it from that point of view: for as though to illustrate the point, not one of these experts in armor-fighting has ever yet become distinguished in war.","And yet those who get a name for anything else do so from the practice of it.","It seems these folk, compared to others, have in this respect been quite remarkably unfortunate.","For instance, take this fellow Stesilaus, whom you and I watched putting on a show in that great crowd and boasting about himself.","I watched him elsewhere under real conditions put on a better show-though not voluntarily.","The warship he was serving on rammed a merchantman,","and he was fighting with a sicklespear-another kind of weapon for another kind of fellow.","Well, the rest of the story is hardly worth telling,","except for the bit of cleverness about the sickle attached to the spear and what resulted.","As he was fighting, it caught somewhere in the tackle of the merchantman and got stuck.","So Stesilaus pulled, trying to free it, but he couldn't-and ship was passing ship.","So he ran along the side for a while hanging onto his spear,","but when ship sheared off from ship and drew him with it,","still hanging onto his spear, the spear pulled through his hand until all he had hold of was the end of the shaft.","There was laughter and applause from the crew of the merchantman at the figure he made,","and when somebody threw a stone at the deck by his feet he let go of the spear,","and at that point even the crew of his own trireme could no longer contain their laughter at seeing that sickle-spear dangling from the rigging.","Well, maybe there's something in this, as Nicias says,","but my own experience of it has been things like this.","So as I said to begin with, it's not worth trying to learn whether it's a study of small usefulness,","or whether they claim and pretend it's a subject of study when it isn't.","In fact, I think if a coward supposed he knew it, he'd only become more rash because of it,","and his cowardice would become even more evident;","but if he were courageous, people would be on guard against him, and if he made even a little mistake, he'd incur great prejudice.","For pretensions to such knowledge rouse jealousy,","so that unless one is astonishingly superior in virtue to the rest, it's impossible to escape becoming a laughingstock by claiming to have this knowledge.","So that's about what I think of taking this study seriously, Lysimachus.","But as I told you to begin with, don't let Socrates here go,","but ask him to advise us what he thinks about the subject before us."]},{character:d.Lysimachus,speech:["Why, I do ask it, Socrates.","In fact I think our council needs a casting vote, as it were.","It would scarcely be needed if these two were in agreement, but as it is, Laches and Nicias vote on opposite sides, as you see.","So it would be good to hear also from you, and to hear which of the two you vote with."]},{character:d.Socrates,speech:["Really, Lysimachus?

Haven't you ever seen people who've become more expert without teachers than with them?"]},{character:d.Socrates,speech:["Yes, Laches, I have.

For they'd never fearlessly declare what pursuits are beneficial and harmful for a young man unless they were confident they adequately know.","Now, in other matters I have confidence in them, but I was surprised that they disagreed with each other in this.","So, Lysimachus, just as Laches a moment ago urged you not to let me go but to question me, so I now ask you in turn not to let Laches go, nor Nicias either, but to question them, saying,","\"Socrates denies that he understands the matter, or that he's adequate to judge which of you is speaking the truth\u2014for he has neither discovered nor learned this sort of thing.","But you, Laches and Nicias, will each please tell us the most skilled person you've met in the nurture of the young, and whether you know because you learned it from another or discovered it for yourselves.","And if you learned it, who your teachers in either case were and who were their fellow practitioners, so that should you lack leisure due to the affairs of the city,","we may go to them and persuade them with gifts or favors or both to care for our children and yours, so that they won't disgrace their forebears by turning out worthless.","But if you understand because you've discovered this sort of thing yourselves, please give an example of others you've already cared for and made noble and good where before they were worthless.","For if you're now beginning to educate for the first time, you must take care lest you put at risk not a Carian slave;","but your own sons and the children of your friends\u2014lest, in short, as the proverb has it, you begin pottery on a big pot.",'State then which of these you assert or deny to pertain and apply to you."',"Ask them that, Lysimachus, and don't let them go."]},{character:d.Lysimachus,speech:["I think Socrates speaks well, gentlemen.","But it's for you to decide, Nicias and Laches, whether you wish to be questioned and render an account of such matters.","As for myself and Melesias here, we'd clearly be pleased if you were ready to go through an account of everything Socrates asks; in fact, we began by saying that we'd summoned you to counsel because we believe you're concerned about such matters as this, as is natural, especially since your sons are almost, as ours actually are, of an age to be educated.","So if it's all the same to you, please join Socrates in common inquiry, rendering and receiving an account from each other.","For he's surely right to say that we're now taking counsel about our most important possession.","Do you agree to the inquiry?"]},{character:d.Nicias,speech:["I think you really know Socrates only through his father, Lysimachus, and haven't associated with him except as a child, if perhaps he followed along after his father and met you at temple or some other gathering among the people of your deme.","You clearly haven't met him since he grew up."]},{character:d.Lysimachus,speech:["Why, in particular, Nicias?"]},{character:d.Nicias,speech:["I don't think you realize that whoever is nearest Socrates and joins him in conversation, even if the conversation perhaps begins with something else, is necessarily drawn round and round by him in argument without pause until he's trapped into rendering an account of himself, and what kind of life he now leads and has led in the past. Once he is entangled, Socrates will not let him go until Socrates has well and thoroughly put all his ways to the test. I'm used to the fellow, and I know what must be suffered at his hands-yes, and still further, I well know I'll suffer it myself. I delight in being near the man, Lysimachus; I think there's nothing bad in being reminded of what I'm not doing or haven't done well. On the contrary, a man necessarily lives the rest of his life with more forethought if he doesn't avoid this but is willing, as Solon says, to continue learning as long as he lives,\" and doesn't assume that old age by itself brings intelligence. For me, there's nothing unaccustomed or unpleasant in being put to the test by Socrates; indeed, I pretty well knew awhile ago that with Socrates present the discussion would not be about the young men but about ourselves. So, as I say, for my part nothing prevents conversing with Socrates in whatever way he wishes. But see how Laches here is disposed in the matter."]},{character:d.Laches,speech:["I'm simpleminded about arguments, Nicias\u2014or, if you will, not simple but of two minds. Actually, I'd seem to some to love argument and also to hate it. For when I hear a man discussing virtue or any kind of wisdom, if he's genuinely a man and worthy of the words he speaks, I am exceedingly delighted, because I look at once to the speaker and what he says to see that they fit each other and are in accord. A man like that seems to me entirely musical: he has not brought into most noble attunement a lyre or an instrument of entertainment, but really brought into attunement his own life, a concord of words fitted to deeds quite in the Dorian mode\u2014the only mode which is solely Greek, as distinct from the Ionian or Phrygian or Lydian. Well, a man like that makes me delight in his utterance, makes me seem to everyone to be a lover of argument\u2014so eagerly do I accept what he says. But someone who does the opposite of this pains me, the more by so much as he seems to speak better, and he on the other hand makes me seem to hate argument. I have no experience of the arguments of Socrates, but before this I put his deeds to the test, I think, and there found him worthy of noble words and all frankness of speech. So if he has that too, I'm of one mind with the man; I'd be very pleased to be examined by such a person, and I wouldn't be distressed at learning. For I agree with Solon too, with only one addition. I'm willing as I grow older to be taught many things, but only by good men. Grant that my teacher is himself good, so that I may not appear hard to teach and displeased at learning. I don't care if the teacher is younger than I am, or not yet famous, or anything of the sort. I invite you then, Socrates, to teach and refute me however you may wish, and to learn at least what I know. I've been disposed this way toward you since that day in which we passed through peril together and you gave proof of your own virtue, which a man must give if he intends to give rightly. So say what you like, and without regard to our difference in age."]},{character:d.Socrates,speech:["It seems I'll have no reason to blame any of you for not being ready to join in counsel and inquiry."]},{character:d.Lysimachus,speech:["But that's our task, Socrates\u2014for I count you as one of us.

Because nowadays I forget many things I intended to say because of my age, and I also forget what I heard, and if other arguments come in the middle, I don't remember them at all. So you must speak and explain among yourselves the subject we proposed; I'll listen and, along with Melesias here, I'll do what you think best."]},{character:d.Socrates,speech:["Well, Nicias and Laches, we must be persuaded by Lysirnachus and Melesias. Perhaps it's no bad thing to ask ourselves what we just undertook to consider, namely, who our teachers in this sort of education have been, or whom we've made better. But I suppose the following kind of inquiry bears on the same issue and is perhaps more nearly fundamental: if we happen to know of anything whatever that, being present to something, makes that to which it is present better, and if in addition we are able to make it come to be present to that thing, it is clear that we know the thing about which we might become advisors as to how one might best and most easily possess it. Perhaps you don't understand what I mean, and you'll learn more easily this way. If we know that sight, when present to eyes, makes that to which it is present better, and if in addition we're able to make it come to be present to eyes, clearly we know what sight itself is, about which we may become counselors as to how one might best and most easily possess it.

So similarly again farming, concerning things which grow from the soil. And no doubt you would yourselves testify that in warfare generalship best exercises forethought specifically about what will happen in future; nor does it suppose it ought to serve but rather to rule prophecy, the seer's art, because it better knows what happens and what will happen in war.

Well, you seem to me to do a very human thing: you don't look at all at yourself but at others. I think I've spoken suitably about the things we just now were discussing, and if anything has not been adequately said, I'll correct it later with the help of Damon-whom you apparently think it proper to laugh at, and this without ever having laid eyes on Damon-and with the help of others.

How then choose any of us? Better then choose none. Since this is so, consider whether my advice is worthwhile. For I say, gentlemen-just among ourselves-that all of us jointly should first seek the best possible teacher for ourselves-for we need him-and afterward for the young men, sparing neither expense nor aught else. I do not advise that we allow ourselves to be as we now are.

but there is no time when non-lovers naturally repent.","For they do kindnesses to the best of their ability, not under compulsion, but of their free will, according to their view of their own best interest.","And besides, lovers consider the injury they have done to their own concerns on account of their love, and the benefits they have conferred, and they add the trouble they have had, and so they think they have long ago made sufficient return to the beloved ;","but non-lovers cannot aver neglect of their own affairs because of their condition, nor can they take account of the pains they have been at in the past, nor lay any blame for quarrels with their relatives ;","and so, since all these evils are removed, there is nothing left for them but to do eagerly what they think will please the beloved.","And besides, if lovers ought to be highly esteemed because they say they have the greatest love for the objects of their passion, since both by word and deed they are ready to make themselves hated by others to please the beloved, it is easy to see that,","if what they say is true, whenever they fall in love afterwards, they will care for the new love more than for the old and will certainly injure the old love, if that pleases the new.","And how can one reasonably entrust matters of such importance to one who is afflicted with a disease such that no one of any experience would even try to cure it?","For they themselves confess that they are insane, rather than in their right mind, and that they know they are foolish, but cannot control themselves ;","and so, how could they, when they have come to their senses, think those acts were good which they determined upon when in such a condition?","And if you were to choose the best from among your lovers, your choice would be limited to a few ;","whereas it would be made from a great number, if you chose the most congenial from non-lovers, so that you would have a better chance, in choosing among many, of finding the one most worthy of your affection.","Now if you are afraid of public opinion, and fear that if people find out your love affair you will be disgraced, consider that lovers, believing that others would be as envious of them as they are of others, are likely to be excited by possession and in their pride to show everybody that they have not toiled in vain ;","but the non-lovers, since they have control of their feelings, are likely to choose what is really best, rather than to court the opinion of mankind.","Moreover, many are sure to notice and see the lovers going about with their beloved ones and making that their chief business,","and so, when they are seen talking with each other, people think they are met in connection with some love-matter either past or future ;","but no one ever thinks of finding fault with non-lovers because they meet, since everyone knows that one must converse with somebody, either because of friendship or because it is pleasant for some other reason.","And then, too, if you are frightened by the thought that it is hard for friendship to last, and that under other circumstances any quarrel would be an equal misfortune to both, but that when you have surrendered what you prize most highly you would be the chief sufferer,","it would be reasonable for you to be more afraid of the lovers ; for they are pained by many things and they think everything that happens is done for the sake of hurting them.","Therefore they prevent their loves from associating with other men, for they fear the wealthy, lest their money give them an advantage, and the educated, lest they prove superior in intellect ;","and they are on their guard against the influence of everyone who possesses any other good thing.","If now they persuade you to incur the dislike of all these, they involve you in a dearth of friends, and if you consider your own interest and are more sensible than they, you will have to quarrel with them.","But those who are not in love, but who have gained the satisfaction of their desires because of their merit, would not be jealous of those who associated with you,","but would hate those who did not wish to do so, thinking that you are slighted by these last and benefited by the former, so that there is much more likelihood that they will gain friendship than enmity from their love-affair with you.","And then, too, many lovers are moved by physical passion before they know the character or have become acquainted with the connections of the beloved,","so that it is uncertain whether they will wish to be your friends after their passion has ceased.","But in the case of those who are not in love, who were your friends before entering into the closer relation, the favours received are not likely to make the friendship less, but will remain as pledges of future joys.","And then, too, it will be better for your character to yield to me than to a lover.","For lovers praise your words and acts beyond due measure, partly through fear of incurring your displeasure, and partly because their own judgment is obscured by their passion.","For such are the exhibitions of the power of Love :","he makes the unsuccessful lovers think that things are grievous which cause no pain to others, and he compels the successful to praise what ought not to give pleasure ;","therefore those whom they love are more to be pitied than envied.","But if you yield to me, I shall consort with you, not with a view to present pleasure only, but to future advantage also, not being overcome by passion but in full control of myself,","and not taking up violent enmity because of small matters, but slowly gathering little anger when the transgressions are great, forgiving involuntary wrongs and trying to prevent intentional ones;","for these are the proofs of a friendship that will endure for a long time.","But if you have a notion that friendship cannot be firm unless one is in love, you should bear in mind that in that case we should not have great affection for sons or for fathers and mothers,","nor should we possess faithful friends who have been gained not through passion but through associations of a different kind.","Besides, if you ought to grant favours to those who ask for them most eagerly, you ought in other matters also to confer benefits, not on the best, but on the most needy ; for they will be most grateful, since they are relieved of the greatest ills.","And then, too, at private entertainments you ought not to invite your friends, but beggars and those who need a meal ; for they will love you and attend you and come to your doors and be most pleased and grateful, and will call down many blessings upon your head.","Perhaps, however, you ought not to grant favours to those who beg for them, but to those who are most able to repay you ; and not to those who ask merely, but to the most deserving ;","and not to those who will enjoy your youthful beauty, but to those who will share their good things with you when you are older ; and not to those who, when they have succeeded, will boast to others of their success, but to those who will modestly keep it a secret from all ;","and not to those who will be enamoured for a little while, but to those who will be your friends for life ; and not to those who will seek a pretext for a quarrel when their passion has died out, but to those who will show their own merit when your youth is passed.","Do you, then, remember what I have said, and bear this also in mind, that lovers are admonished by their friends, who think their way of life is bad, but no relative ever blamed a non-lover for bad management of his own interests on account of that condition.","Perhaps you may ask me if I advise you to grant favours to all non-lovers.","But I think the lover would not urge you to be so disposed toward all lovers either ; for the favour, if scattered broadcast, is not so highly prized by the rational recipient, nor can you, if you wish, keep your relations with one hidden from the rest.","But from love no harm ought to come, but benefit to both parties.","Now I think I have said enough.

Now there was once upon a time a boy, or rather a stripling, of great beauty : and he had many lovers. And among these was one of peculiar craftiness, who was as much in love with the boy as anyone, but had made him believe that he was not in love ; and once in wooing him, he tried to persuade him of this very thing, that favours ought to be granted rather to the non-lover than to the lover ; and his words were as follows : There is only one way, dear boy, for those to begin who are to take counsel wisely about anything. One must know what the counsel is about, or it is sure to be utterly futile, but most people are ignorant of the fact that they do not know the nature of things. So, supposing that they do know it, they come to no agreement in the beginning of their enquiry, and as they go on they reach the natural result, they agree neither with themselves nor with each other. Now you and I must not fall into the error which we condemn in others, but, since we are to discuss the question, whether the lover or the non-lover is to be preferred let us first agree on a definition of love, its nature and its power, and then, keeping this definition in view and making constant reference to it, let us enquire whether love brings advantage or harm. Now everyone sees that love is a desire ; and we know too that non-lovers also desire the beautiful. How then are we to distinguish the lover from the non-lover? We must observe that in each one of us there are two ruling and leading principles, which we follow whithersoever they lead ; one is the innate desire for pleasures, the other an acquired opinion which strives for the best. These two sometimes agree within us and are sometimes in strife ; and sometimes one, and sometimes the other has the greater power. Now when opinion leads through reason toward the best and is more powerful, its power is called self-restraint, but when desire irrationally drags us toward pleasures and rules within us, its rule is called excess. Now excess has many names, for it has many members and many forms ; and whichever of these forms is most marked gives its own name, neither beautiful nor honourable, to him who possesses it. For example, if the desire for food prevails over the higher reason and the other desires, it is called gluttony, and he who possesses it will be called by the corresponding name of glutton, and again, if the desire for drink becomes the tyrant and leads him who possesses it toward drink, we know what he is called ; and it is quite clear what fitting names of the same sort will be given when any desire akin to these acquires the rule. The reason for what I have said hitherto is pretty clear by this time, but everything is plainer when spoken than when unspoken ; so I say that the desire which overcomes the rational opinion that strives toward the right, and which is led away toward the enjoyment of beauty and again is strongly forced by the desires that are kindred to itself toward personal beauty, when it gains the victory, takes its name from that very force, and is called love. 1 Well, my dear Phaedrus, does it seem to you, as it does to me, that I am inspired?"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Certainly, Socrates, you have an unusual fluency."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Then listen to me in silence ; for truly the place seems filled with a divine presence ; so do not be surprised if I often seem to be in a frenzy as my discourse progresses, for I am already almost uttering dithyrambics."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["That is very true."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:['You are responsible for that ; but hear what follows ; for perhaps the attack may be averted. That, however, is in the hands of God ; we must return to our boy. Well then, my dearest, what the subject is, about which we are to take counsel, has been said and defined, and now let us continue, keeping our attention fixed upon that definition, and tell what advantage or harm will naturally come from the lover or the non-lover to him who grants them his favours. He who is ruled by desire and is a slave to pleasure will inevitably desire to make his beloved as pleasing to himself as possible. Now to one who is of unsound mind everything is pleasant which does not oppose him, but everything that is better or equal is hateful. So the lover will not, if he can help it, endure a beloved who is better than himself or his equal, but always makes him weaker and inferior ; but the ignorant is inferior to the wise, the coward to the brave, the poor speaker to the eloquent, the slow of wit to the clever. Such mental defects, and still greater than these, in the beloved will necessarily please the lover, if they are implanted by Nature, and if they are not, he must implant them or be deprived of his immediate enjoyment. And he is of necessity jealous and will do him great harm by keeping him from many advantageous associations, which would most tend to make a man of him, especially from that which would do most to make him wise. This is divine philosophy, and from it the lover will certainly keep his beloved away, through fear of being despised ; and he will contrive to keep him ignorant of everything else and make him look to his lover for everything, so that he will be most agreeable to him and most harmful to himself. In respect to the intellect, then, a man in love is by no means a profitable guardian or associate. We must next consider how he who is forced to follow pleasure and not good will keep the body of him whose master he is, and what care he will give to it. He will plainly court a beloved who is effeminate, not virile, not brought up in the pure sunshine, but in mingled shade, unused to manly toils and the sweat of exertion, but accustomed to a delicate and unmanly mode of life, adorned with a bright complexion of artificial origin, since he has none by nature, and in general living a life such as all this indicates, which it is certainly not worth while to describe further. We can sum it all up briefly and pass on. A person with such a body, in war and in all important crises, gives courage to his enemies, and fills his friends, and even his lovers themselves, with fear. This may be passed over as self-evident, but the next question, what advantage or harm the intercourse and guardianship of the lover will bring to his beloved in the matter of his property, must be discussed. Now it is clear to everyone, and especially to the lover, that he would desire above all things to have his beloved bereft of the dearest and kindest and holiest possessions ; for he would wish him to be deprived of father, mother, relatives and friends, thinking that they would hinder and censure his most sweet intercourse with him. But he will also think that one who has property in money or other possessions will be less easy to catch and when caught will be less manageable ; wherefore the lover must necessarily begrudge his beloved the possession of property and rejoice at its loss. Moreover the lover would wish his beloved to be as long as possible unmarried, childless, and homeless, since he wishes to enjoy as long as possible what is pleasant to himself. Now there are also other evils, but God has mingled with most of them some temporary pleasure ; so, for instance, a flatterer is a horrid creature and does great harm, yet Nature has combined with him a kind of pleasure that is not without charm, and one might find fault with a courtesan as an injurious thing, and there are many other such creatures and practices which are yet for the time being very pleasant ; but a lover is not only harmful to his beloved but extremely disagreeable to live with as well. The old proverb says, " birds of a feather flock together " ; that is, I suppose, equality of age leads them to similar pleasures and through similarity begets friendship ; and yet even they grow tired of each other\'s society. Now compulsion of every kind is said to be oppressive to every one, and the lover not only is unlike his beloved, but he exercises the strongest compulsion. For he is old while his love is young, and he does not leave him day or night, if he can help it, but is driven by the sting of necessity, which urges him on, always giving him pleasure in seeing, hearing, touching, and by aH his senses perceiving his beloved, so that he is glad to serve him constantly. But what consolation or what pleasure can he give the beloved? Must not this protracted intercourse bring him to the uttermost disgust, as he looks at the old, unlovely face, and other things to match, which it is not pleasant even to hear about, to say nothing of being constantly compelled to come into contact with them? And he is suspiciously guarded in all ways against everybody, and has to listen to untimely and exaggerated praises and to reproaches which are unendurable when the man is sober, and when he is in his cups and indulges in wearisome and unrestrained freedom of speech become not only unendurable but disgusting. And while he is in love he is harmful and disagreeable, but when his love has ceased he is thereafter false to him whom he formerly hardly induced to endure his wearisome companionship through the hope of future benefits by making promises with many prayers and oaths. But now that the time of payment has come he has a new ruler and governor within him, sense and reason in place of love and madness, and has become a different person ; but of this his beloved knows nothing. He asks of him a return for former favours, reminding him of past sayings and doings, as if he were speaking to the same man ; but the lover is ashamed to say that he has changed, and yet he cannot keep the oaths and promises he made when he was ruled by his former folly, now that he has regained his reason and come to his senses, lest by doing what he formerly did he become again what he was. He runs away from these things, and the former lover is compelled to become a defaulter. The shell has fallen with the other side up ; 1 and he changes his part and runs away ; and the other is forced to run after him in anger and with imprecations, he who did not know at the start that he ought never to have accepted a lover who was necessarily without reason, but rather a reasonable non-lover ; for otherwise he would have to surrender himself to one who was faithless, irritable, jealous, and disagreeable, harmful to his property, harmful to his physical condition, and most harmful by far to the cultivation of his soul, than which there neither is nor ever will be anything of higher importance in truth either in heaven or on earth. These things, dear boy, you must bear in mind, and you must know that the fondness of the lover is not a matter of goodwill, but of appetite which he wishes to satisfy : Just as the wolf loves the lamb, so the lover adores his beloved. There it is, Phaedrus! Do not listen to me any longer ; let my speech end here.']},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["But I thought you were in the middle of it, and would say as much about the non-lover as you have said about the lover, to set forth all his good points and show that he ought to be favoured.

Now I am a seer, not a very good one, but, as the bad writers say, good enough for my own purposes ; so now I understand my error. How prophetic the soul is, my friend!

Now I, my friend, must purify myself ; and for those who have sinned in matters of mythology there is an ancient purification, unknown to Homer, but known to Stesichoms. For when he was stricken with blindness for speaking ill of Helen, he was not, like Homer, ignorant of the reason, but since he was educated, he knew it and straightway he writes the poem: " That saying is not true ; thou didst not go within the well-oared ships, nor didst thou come to the walls of Troy " ; l and when he had written all the poem, which is called the recantation, he saw again at once.

And I must say that this saying is not true, which teaches that when a lover is at hand the non-lover should be more favoured, because the lover is insane, and the other sane. For if it were a simple fact that insanity is an evil, the saying would be true ; but in reality the greatest of blessings come to us through madness, when it is sent as a gift of the gods. For the prophetess at Delphi and the priestesses at Dodona when they have been mad have conferred many splendid benefits upon Greece both in private and in public affairs, but few or none when they have been in their right minds ; and if we should speak of the Sibyl and all the others who by prophetic inspiration have foretold many things to many persons and thereby made them fortunate afterwards, anyone can see that we should speak a long time. And it is worth while to adduce also the fact that those men of old who invented names thought that madness was neither shameful nor disgraceful ; otherwise they would not have connected the very word mania with the noblest of arts, that which foretells the future, by calling it the manic art. No, they gave this name thinking that mania, when it comes by gift of the gods, is a noble thing, but nowadays people call prophecy the mantic art, tastelessly inserting a T in the word. So also, when they gave a name to the investigation of the future which rational persons conduct through observation of birds and by other signs, since they furnish mind (nous) and information (historia) to human thought (oiesis) from the intellect (dianoia) they called it the oionoistic (oionoistike) art, which modern folk now call oionistic, making it more high-sounding by introducing the long O. The ancients, then testify that in proportion as prophecy (mantike) is superior to augury, both in name and in fact, in the same proportion madness, which comes from god, is superior to sanity, which is of human origin. Moreover, when diseases and the greatest troubles have been visited upon certain families through some ancient guilt, madness has entered in and by oracular power has found a way of release for those in need, taking refuge in prayers and the service of the gods, and so, by purifications and sacred rites, he who has this madness is made safe for the present and the after time, and for him who is rightly possessed of madness a release from present ills is found. And a third kind of possession and madness comes from the Muses. This takes hold upon a gentle and pure soul, arouses it and inspires it to songs and other poetry, and thus by adorning countless deeds of the ancients educates later generations. But he who without the divine madness comes to the doors of the Muses, confident that he will be a good poet by art, meets with no success, and the poetry of the sane man vanishes into nothingness before that of the inspired madmen. All these noble results of inspired madness I can mention, and many more. Therefore let us not be afraid on that point, and let no one disturb and frighten us by saying that the reasonable friend should be preferred to him who is in a frenzy. Let him show in addition that love is not sent from heaven for the advantage of lover and beloved alike, and we will grant him the prize of victory. We, on our part, must prove that such madness is given by the gods for our greatest happiness ; and our proof will not be believed by the merely clever, but will be accepted by the truly wise. First, then, we must learn the truth about the soul divine and human by observing how it acts and is acted upon. And the beginning of our proof is as follows : Every soul is immortal. For that which is ever moving is immortal ; but that which moves something else or is moved by something else, when it ceases to move, ceases to live. Only that which moves itself, since it does not leave itself, never ceases to move, and this is also the source and beginning of motion for all other things which have motion. But the beginning is ungenerated. For everything that is generated must be generated from a beginning, but the beginning is not generated from anything ; for if the beginning were generated from anything, it would not be generated from a beginning. And since it is ungenerated, it must be also indestructible ; for if the beginning were destroyed, it could never be generated from anything nor anything else from it, since all things must be generated from a beginning. Thus that which moves itself must be the beginning of motion. And this can be neither destroyed nor generated, otherwise all the heavens and all generation must fall in ruin and stop and never again have any source of motion or origin. But since that which is moved by itself has been seen to be immortal, one who says that this self-motion is the essence and the very idea of the soul, will not be disgraced. For every body which derives motion from without is soulless, but that which has its motion within itself has a soul, since that is the nature of the soul ; but if this is true, that that which moves itself is nothing else than the soul, then the soul would necessarily be ungenerated and immortal. Concerning the immortality of the soul this is enough ; but about its form we must speak in the following manner. To tell what it really is would be a matter for utterly superhuman and long discourse, but it is within human power to describe it briefly in a figure ; let us therefore speak in that way. We will liken the soul to the composite nature of a pair of winged horses and a charioteer. Now the horses and charioteers of the gods are all good and of good descent, but those of other races are mixed ; and first the charioteer of the human soul drives a pair, and secondly one of the horses is noble and of noble breed, but the other quite the opposite in breed and character. Therefore in our case the driving is necessarily difficult and troublesome. Now we must try to tell why a living being is called mortal or immortal. Soul, considered collectively, has the care of all that which is soulless, and it traverses the whole heaven, appearing sometimes in one form and sometimes in another ; now when it is perfect and fully winged, it mounts upward and governs the whole world ; but the soul which has lost its wings is borne along until it gets hold of something solid, when it settles down, taking upon itself an earthly body, which seems to be self-moving, because of the power of the soul within it ; and the whole, compounded of soul and body, is called a living being, and is further designated as mortal. It is not immortal by any reasonable supposition, but we, though we have never seen or rightly conceived a god, imagine an\' immortal being which has both a soul and a body which are united for all time. Let that, however, and our words concerning it, be as is pleasing to God ; we will now consider the reason why the soul loses its wings. It is something like this. The natural function of the wing is to soar upwards and carry that which is heavy up to the place where dwells the race of the gods. More than any other thing that pertains to the body it partakes of the nature of the divine. But the divine is beauty, wisdom, goodness, and all such qualities ; by these then the wings of the soul are nourished and grow, but by the opposite qualities, such as vileness and evil, they are wasted away and destroyed. Now the great leader in heaven, Zeus, driving a winged chariot, goes first, arranging all things and caring for all things. He is followed by an army of gods and spirits, arrayed in eleven squadrons ; Hestia alone remains in the house of the gods. Of the rest, those who are included among the twelve great gods and are accounted leaders, are assigned each to his place in the army. There are many blessed sights and many ways hither and thither within the heaven, along which the blessed gods go to and fro attending each to his own duties ; and whoever wishes, and is able, follows, for jealousy is excluded from the celestial band. But when they go to a feast and a banquet, they proceed steeply upward to the top of the vault of heaven, where the chariots of the gods, whose well matched horses obey the rein, advance easily, but the others with difficulty ; for the horse of evil nature weighs the chariot down, making it heavy and pulling toward the earth the charioteer whose horse is not well trained. There the utmost toil and struggle await the soul. For those that are called immortal, when they reach the top, pass outside and take their place on the outer surface of the heaven, and when they have taken their stand, the revolution carries them round and they behold the things outside of the heaven. But the region above the heaven was never worthily sung by any earthly poet, nor will it ever be. It is, however, as I shall tell ; for I must dare to speak the truth, especially as truth is my theme. For the colourless, formless, and intangible truly existing essence, with which all true knowledge is concerned, holds this region and is visible only to the mind, the pilot of the soul. Now the divine intelligence, since it is nurtured on mind and pure knowledge, and the intelligence of every soul which is capable of receiving that which befits it, rejoices in seeing reality for a space of time and by gazing upon truth is nourished and made happy until the revolution brings it again to the same place. In the revolution it beholds absolute justice, temperance, and knowledge, not such knowledge as has a beginning and varies as it is associated with one or another of the things we call realities, but that which abides in the real eternal absolute ; and in the same way it beholds and feeds upon the other eternal verities, after which, passing down again within the heaven, it goes home, and there the charioteer puts up the horses at the manger and feeds them with ambrosia and then gives them nectar to drink. Such is the life of the gods ; but of the other souls, that which best follows after God and is most like him, raises the head of the charioteer up into the outer region and is carried round in the revolution, troubled by the horses and hardly beholding the realities ; and another sometimes rises and sometimes sinks, and, because its horses are unruly, it sees some things and fails to see others. The other souls follow after, all yearning for the upper region but unable to reach it, and are carried round beneath, trampling upon and colliding with one another, each striving to pass its neighbour. So there is the greatest confusion and sweat of rivalry, wherein many are lamed, and many wings are broken through the incompetence of the drivers ; and after much toil they all go away without gaining a view of reality, and when they have gone away they feed upon opinion. But the reason of the great eagerness to see where the plain of truth is, lies in the fact that the fitting pasturage for the best part of the soul is in the meadow there, and the wing on which the soul is raised up is nourished by this. And this is a law of Destiny, that the soul which follows after God and obtains a view of any of the truths is free from harm until the next period, and if it can always attain this, is always unharmed ; but when, through inability to follow, it fails to see, and through some mischance is filled with forgetfulness and evil and grows heavy, and when it has grown heavy, loses its wings and falls to the earth, then it is the law that this soul shall never pass into any beast at its first birth, but the soul that has seen the most shall enter into the birth of a man who is to be a philosopher or a lover of beauty, or one of a musical or loving nature, and the second soul into that of a lawful king or a warlike ruler, and the third into that of a politician or a man of business or a financier, the fourth into that of a hard-working gymnast or one who will be concerned with the cure of the body, and the fifth will lead the life of a prophet or someone who conducts mystic rites ; to the sixth, a poet or some other imitative artist will be united, to the seventh, a craftsman or a husbandman, to the eighth, a sophist or a demagogue, to the ninth, a tyrant. Now in all these states, whoever lives justly obtains a better lot, and whoever lives unjustly, a worse. For each soul returns to the place whence it came in ten thousand years ; for it does not regain its wings before that time has elapsed, except the soul of him who has been a guileless philosopher or a philosophical lover ; these, when for three successive periods of a thousand years they have chosen such a life, after the third period of a thousand years become winged in the three thousandth year and go their way ; but the rest, when they have finished their first life, receive judgment, and after the judgment some go to the places of correction under the earth and pay their penalty, while the others, made light and raised up into a heavenly place by justice, live in a manner worthy of the life they led in human form. But in the thousandth year both come to draw lots and choose their second life, each choosing whatever it wishes. Then a human soul may pass into the life of a beast, and a soul which was once human, may pass again from a beast into a man. For the soul which has never seen the truth can never pass into human form. For a human being must understand a general conception formed by collecting into a unity by means of reason the many perceptions of the senses ; and this is a recollection of those things which our soul once beheld, when it journeyed with God and, lifting its vision above the things which we now say exist, rose up into real being. And therefore it is just that the mind of the philosopher only has wings, for he is always, so far as he is able, in communion through memory with those things the communion with which causes God to be divine. Now a man who employs such memories rightly is always being initiated into perfect mysteries and he alone becomes truly perfect ; but since he separates himself from human interests and turns his attention toward the divine, he is rebuked by the vulgar, who consider him mad and do not know that he is inspired. All my discourse so far has been about the fourth kind of madness, which causes him to be regarded as mad, who, when he sees the beauty on earth, remembering the true beauty, feels his wings growing and longs to stretch them for an upward flight, but cannot do so, and, like a bird, gazes upward and neglects the things below. My discourse has shown that this is, of all inspirations, the best and of the highest origin to him who has it or who shares in it, and that he who loves the beautiful, partaking in this madness, is called a lover. For, as has been said, every soul of man has by the law of nature beheld the realities, otherwise it would not have entered into a human being, but it is not easy for all souls to gain from earthly things a recollection of those realities, either for those which had but a brief view of them at that earlier time, or for those which, after falling to earth, were so unfortunate as to be turned toward unrighteousness through some evil communications and to have forgotten the holy sights they once saw. Few then are left which retain an adequate recollection of them ; but these when they see here any likeness of the things of that other world, are stricken with amazement and can no longer control themselves ; but they do not understand their condition, because they do not clearly perceive. Now in the earthly copies of justice and temperance and the other ideas which are precious to souls there is no light, but only a few, approaching the images through the darkling organs of sense, behold in them the nature of that which they imitate, and these few do this with difficulty. But at that former time they saw beauty shining in brightness, when, with a blessed company we following in the train of Zeus, and others in that of some other god they saw the blessed sight and vision and were initiated into that which is rightly called the most blessed of mysteries, which we celebrated in a state of perfection, when we were without experience of the evils which awaited us in the time to come, being permitted as initiates to the sight of perfect and simple and calm and happy apparitions, which we saw in the pure light, being ourselves pure and not entombed in this which we carry about with us and call the body, in which we are imprisoned like an oyster in its shell.. So much, then, in honour of memory, on account of which I have now spoken at some length, through yearning for the joys of that other time. But beauty, as I said before, shone in brilliance among those visions ; and since we came to earth we have found it shining most clearly through the clearest of our senses ; for sight is the sharpest of the physical senses, though wisdom is not seen by it, for wisdom would arouse terrible love, if such a clear image of it were granted as would come through sight, and the same is true of the other lovely realities ; but beauty alone has this privilege, and therefore it is most clearly seen and loveliest. Now he who is not newly initiated, or lias been corrupted, does not quickly rise from this world to that other world and to absolute beauty when he sees its namesake here, and so he does not revere it when he looks upon it, but gives himself up to pleasure and like a beast proceeds to lust and begetting; he makes licence his companion and is not afraid or ashamed to pursue pleasure in violation of nature. But he who is newly initiated, who beheld many of those realities, when he sees a god-like face or form which is a good image of beauty, shudders at first, and something of the old awe comes over him, then, as he gazes, he reveres the beautiful one as a god, and if he did not fear to be thought stark mad, he would offer sacrifice to his beloved as to an idol or a god. And as he looks upon him, a reaction from his shuddering comes over him, with sweat and unwonted heat ; for as the effluence of beauty enters him through the eyes, he is warmed ; the effluence moistens the germ of the feathers, and as he grows warm, the parts from which the feathers grow, which were before hard and choked, and prevented the feathers from sprouting, become soft, and as the nourishment streams upon him, the quills of the feathers swell and begin to grow from the roots over all the form of the soul ; for it was once all feathered. Now in this process the whole soul throbs and palpitates, and as in those who are cutting teeth there is an irritation and discomfort in the gums, when the teeth begin to grow, just so the soul suffers when the growth of the feathers begins ; it is feverish and is uncomfortable and itches when they begin to grow. Then when it gazes upon the beauty of the boy and receives the particles which flow thence to it (for which reason they are called yearning), 1 it is moistened and warmed, ceases from its pain and is filled with joy ; but when it is alone and grows dry, the mouths of the passages in which the feathers begin to grow become dry and close up, shutting in the sprouting feathers, and the sprouts within, shut in with the yearning, throb like pulsing arteries, and each sprout pricks the passage in which it is, so that the whole soul, stung in every part, rages with pain ; and then again, remembering the beautiful one, it rejoices. So, because ot these two mingled sensations, it is greatly troubled by its strange condition ; it is perplexed and maddened, and in its madness it cannot sleep at night or stay in any one place by day, but it is filled with longing and hastens wherever it hopes to see the beautiful one. And when it sees him and is bathed with the waters of yearning, the passages that were sealed are opened, the soul has respite from the stings and is eased of its pain, and this pleasure which it enjoys is the sweetest of pleasures at the time. Therefore the soul will not, if it can help it, be left alone by the beautiful one, but esteems him above all others, forgets for hum mother and brothers and all friends, neglects property and cares not for its loss, and despising all the customs and proprieties in which it formerly took pride, it is ready to be a slave and to sleep wherever it is allowed, as near as possible to the beloved ; for it not only reveres him who possesses beauty, but finds in him the only healer of its greatest woes. Now this condition, fair boy, about which I am speaking, is called Love by men, but when you hear what the gods call it, perhaps because of your youth you will laugh. But some of the Homeridae, I believe, repeat two verses on Love from the spurious poems of Homer, one of which is very outrageous and not perfectly metrical. They sing them as follows : " Mortals call him winged Love, but the immortals call him The Winged One, because he must needs grow wings." You may believe this, or not ; but the condition of lovers and the cause of it are just as I have said. Now he who is a follower of Zeus, when seized by Love can bear a heavier burden of the winged god ; but those who are servants of Ares and followed in his train, when they have been seized by Love and think they have been wronged in any way by the beloved, become murderous and are ready to sacrifice themselves and the beloved. And so it is with the follower of each of the other gods ; he lives, so far as he is able, honouring and imitating that god, so long as he is uncorrupted, and is living his first life on earth, and in that way he behaves and conducts himself toward his beloved and toward all others. Now each one chooses his love from the ranks of the beautiful according to his character, and he fashions him and adorns him like a statue, as though he were his god, to honour and worship him. The followers of Zeus desire that the soul of him whom they love be like Zeus ; so they seek for one of philosophical and lordly nature, and when they find him and love him, they do all they can to give him such a character. If they have not previously had experience, they learn then from all who can teach them anything ; they seek after information themselves, and when they search eagerly within themselves to find the nature of their god, they are successful, because they have been compelled to keep their eyes fixed upon the god, and as they reach and grasp him by memory they are inspired and receive from him character and habits, so far as it is possible for a man to have part in God. Now they consider the beloved the cause of all this, so they love him more than before, and if they draw the waters of their inspiration from Zeus, like the bacchantes, they pour it out upon the beloved and make him, so far as possible, like their god. And those who followed after Hera seek a kingly nature, and when they have found such an one, they act in a corresponding manner toward him in all respects ; and likewise the followers of Apollo, and of each of the gods, go out and seek for their beloved a youth whose nature accords with that of the god, and when they have gained his affection, by imitating the god themselves and by persuasion and education they lead the beloved to the conduct and nature of the god, so far as each of them can do so ; they exhibit no jealousy or meanness toward the loved one, but endeavour by every means in their power to lead him to the likeness of the god whom they honour. Thus the desire of the true lovers, and the initiation into the mysteries of love, which they teach, if they accomplish what they desire in the way I describe, is beautiful and brings happiness from the inspired lover to the loved one, if he be captured ; and the fair one who is captured is caught in the following manner : In the beginning of this tale I divided each soul into three parts, two of which had the form of horses, the third that of a charioteer. Let us retain this division. Now of the horses we say one is good and the other bad ; but we did not define what the goodness of the one and the badness of the other was. That we must now do. The horse that stands at the right hand is upright and has clean limbs ; he carries his neck high, has an aquiline nose, is white in colour, and has dark eyes ; he is a friend of honour joined with temperance and modesty, and a follower of true glory ; he needs no whip, but is guided only by the word of command and by reason. The other, however, is crooked, heavy, ill put together, his neck is short and thick, his nose flat, his colour dark, his eyes grey and bloodshot ; he is the friend of insolence and pride, is shaggy-eared and deaf, hardly obedient to whip and spurs. Now when the charioteer beholds the love-inspiring vision, and his whole soul is warmed by the sight, and is full of the tickling and prickings of yearning, the horse that is obedient to the charioteer, constrained then as always by modesty, controls himself and does not leap upon the beloved ; but the other no longer heeds the pricks or the whip of the charioteer, but springs wildly forward, causing all possible trouble to his mate and to the charioteer, and forcing them to approach the beloved and propose the joys of love. And they at first pull back indignantly and will not be forced to do terrible and unlawful deeds; but finally, as the trouble has no end, they go forward with him, yielding and agreeing to do his bidding. And they come to the beloved and behold his radiant face. And as the charioteer looks upon him, his memory is borne back to the true nature of beauty, and he sees it standing with modesty upon a pedestal of chastity, and when he sees this he is afraid and falls backward in reverence, and in falling he is forced to pull the reins so violently backward as to bring both horses upon their haunches, the one quite willing, since he does not oppose him, but the unruly beast very unwilling. And as they go away, one horse in his shame and wonder wets all the soul with sweat, but the other, as soon as he is recovered from the pain of the bit and the fall, before he has fairly taken breath, breaks forth into angry reproaches, bitterly reviling his mate and the charioteer for their cowardice and lack of manhood in deserting their post and breaking their agreement ; and again, in spite of their unwillingness, he urges them forward and hardly yields to their prayer that he postpone the matter to another time. Then when the time comes which they have agreed upon, they pretend that they have forgotten it, but he reminds them ; struggling, and neighing, and pulling he forces them again with the same purpose to approach the beloved one, and when they are near him, he lowers his head, raises his tail, takes the bit in his teeth, and pulls shamelessly. The effect upon the charioteer is the same as before, but more pronounced ; he falls back like a racer from the starting-rope, pulls the bit backward even more violently than before from the teeth of the unruly horse, covers his scurrilous tongue and jaws with blood, and forces his legs and haunches to the ground, causing him much pain. Now when the bad horse has gone through the same experience many times and has ceased from his unruliness, he is humbled and follows henceforth the wisdom of the charioteer, and when he sees the beautiful one, he is overwhelmed with fear ; and so from that time on the soul of the lover follows the beloved in reverence and .awe. Now the beloved, since he receives all service from his lover, as if he were a god, and since the lover is not feigning, but is really in love, and since the beloved himself is by nature friendly to him who serves him, although he may at some earlier time have been prejudiced by his schoolfellows or others, who said that it was a disgrace to yield to a lover, and may for that reason have repulsed his lover, yet, as time goes on, his youth and destiny cause him to admit him to his society. For it is the law of fate that evil can never be a friend to evil and that good must always be friend to good. And when the lover is thus admitted, and the privilege of conversation and intimacy has been granted him, his good will, as it shows itself in close intimacy, astonishes the beloved, who discovers that the friendship of all his other friends and relatives is as nothing when compared with that of his inspired lover. And as this intimacy continues and the lover comes near and touches the beloved in the gymnasia and in their general intercourse, then the fountain of that stream which Zeus, when he was in love with Ganymede, called " desire " flows copiously upon the lover ; and some of it flows into him, and some, when he is filled, overflows outside ; and just as the wind or an echo rebounds from smooth, hard surfaces and returns whence it came, so the stream of beauty passes back into the beautiful one through the eyes, the natural inlet to the soul, where it reanimates the passages of the feathers, waters them and makes the feathers begin to grow, filling the soul of the loved one with love. So he is in love, but he knows not with whom ; he does not understand his own condition and cannot explain it ; like one who has caught a disease of the eyes from another, he can give no reason for it ; he sees himself in his lover as in a mirror, but is not conscious of the fact. And in the lover\'s presence, like him he ceases from his pain, and in his absence, like him he is filled with yearning such as he inspires, and love\'s image, requited love, dwells within him ; but he calls it, and believes it to be, not love, but friendship. Like the lover, though less strongly, he desires to see his friend, to touch him, kiss him, and lie down by him ; and naturally these things are soon brought about. Now as they lie together, the unruly horse of the lover has something to say to the charioteer, and demands a little enjoyment in return for his many troubles ; and the unruly horse of the beloved says nothing, but teeming with passion and confused emotions he embraces and kisses his lover, caressing him as his best friend ; and when they lie together, he would not refuse his lover any favour, if he asked it ; but the other horse and the charioteer oppose all this with modesty and reason. If now the better elements of the mind, which lead to a well ordered life and to philosophy, prevail, they live a life of happiness and harmony here on earth, self controlled and orderly, holding in subjection that which causes evil in the soul and giving freedom to that which makes for virtue ; and when this life is ended they are light and winged, for they have conquered in one of the three truly Olympic contests. Neither human wisdom nor divine inspiration can confer upon man any greater blessing than this. If however they live a life less noble and without philosophy, but yet ruled by the love of honour, probably, when they have been drinking, or in some other moment of carelessness, the two unruly horses, taking the souls off their guard, will bring them together and seize upon and accomplish that which is by the many accounted blissful ; and when this has once been done, they continue the practice, but infrequently, since what they are doing is not approved by the whole mind. So these two pass through life as friends, though not such friends as the others, both at the time of their love and afterwards, believing that they have exchanged the most binding pledges of love, and that they can never break them and fall into enmity. And at last, when they depart from the body, they are not winged, to be sure, but their wings have begun to grow, so that the madness of love brings them no small reward ; for it is the law that those who have once begun their upward progress shall never again pass into darkness and the journey under the earth, but shall live a happy life in the light as they journey together, and because of their love shall be alike in their plumage when they receive their wings. These blessings, so great and so divine, the friendship of a lover will confer upon you, dear boy ; but the affection of the non-lover, which is alloyed with mortal prudence and follows mortal and parsimonious rules of conduct, will beget in the beloved soul the narrowness which the common folk praise as virtue ; it will cause the soul to be a wanderer upon the earth for nine thousand years and a fool below the earth at last. There, dear Love, thou hast my recantation, which I have offered and paid as beautifully and as well as I could, especially in the poetical expressions which I was forced to employ on account of Phaedrus. Pardon, I pray, my former words and accept these words with favour ; be kind and gracious to me ; do not in anger take from me the art of love which thou didst give me, and deprive me not of sight, but grant unto me to be even more than now esteemed by the beautiful. And if in our former discourse Phaedrus and I said anything harsh against thee, blame Lysias, the father of that discourse, make him to cease from such speeches, and turn him, as his brother Polemarchus is turned, toward philosophy, that his lover Phaedrus may no longer hesitate, as he does now, between two ways, but may direct his life with all singleness of purpose toward love and philosophical discourses.']},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["I join in your prayer, Socrates, and pray that this may come to pass, if this is best for us.

The story goes that Thamus said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would take too long to repeat ; but when they came to the letters, " This invention, O king," said Theuth, "will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories ; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered." But Thamus replied, " Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another ; and now you, who are the father of letters, have been led by your affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess. For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory.

You are aware of my situation and you have heard me explain how, in my opinion, it would be to our advantage if this were to happen.","I think that the fact that I happen not to be in love with you should not prevent me getting what I want.","You should know that a lover regrets the favours he does once his desire comes to an end, whereas it stands to reason that there is never a time when a non-lover will change his mind.","For if he exerts himself to do a favour, he does so willingly, not because he is driven by an irresistible force, and as the best way he can think of to further his own interests.","Moreover, a lover thinks about how he has harmed his own affairs as a result of being in love and about the favours he has done his beloved, takes into consideration all the effort he has put in as well, and concludes that he has long ago paid his beloved the equivalent of any favours he might receive.","A non-lover, however, cannot make being in love an excuse for the neglect of his own business, or take past effort into account, or complain of having fallen out with his relatives.","The upshot is that, lacking any of these difficulties, he is left with nothing except to commit himself to doing whatever he thinks will please the other party.","Moreover, if a lover deserves to be valued because he claims to be so very fond of his beloved that he is ready to incur the hatred of everyone else both by what he says and by what he does in order to please his beloved, it is easy to see that,","if this claim of his is true, he will value anyone with whom he subsequently falls in love more than his present beloved, and it goes without saying that he will treat him badly if that is what his new beloved wants him to do.","Also, how does it make sense to give away such a precious thing to someone suffering from the kind of affliction which stops those who experience it even trying to get rid of it?","After all, a lover admits that he is sick rather than in his right mind; he knows he is deranged, but is incapable of self-control.","And so, when he returns to his senses, how could he think that the decisions he made when he was in this deranged state are sound?","Then again, if you were to pick the best man from among your lovers, you would have a small field from which to make your choice.","But if you were to pick a partner who was most suited to you from among everyone else, you would have a large field to choose from. And so the large field offers you a much better chance of finding someone worthy of your affection.","Now, if you are worried about the moral code\u2014about the stigma that might attach to you if people found out\u2014it stands to reason that a lover, because he thinks that everyone else considers him just as happy as he does himself, will be stimulated by talking about it, and will proudly point out to everyone that his efforts were not in vain,","while a non-lover, who is in control of himself, will choose the best course of action, rather than a worldly reputation.","Moreover, a lover is bound to be found out. He will be seen by many people trailing along after his beloved and making this his chief business,","and so when he and his beloved are spotted talking to each other, people think they are together at that time because they have just satisfied their desires or are just about to.","But it never even crosses their minds to criticize non-lovers for spending time together, because they realize that conversation is inevitable between friends or people enjoying themselves in some other way.","Also, if you are worried by the thought that it is hard for a relationship to last, but that although breaking up normally troubles both friends equally, it would be you who would suffer badly since you have given away what you value most,","it is reasonable for you to be more concerned about a lover than a non-lover, because a lover is easily upset and thinks that everything is designed to do him harm.","That is also why he tries to stop his beloved spending time with others, because he is afraid that those who are well off will prove to have more money than him and that those who have been educated will be more knowledgeable than him\u2014","and he is concerned about what anyone with any other advantage might be able to do.","A lover will therefore persuade you to put these people off, until you reach a state of complete isolation from friends, and if you are more clever than him and look to your own advantage, you will cause a rift between yourself and him.","Someone who is not in love, however, but got what he wanted as a result of his excellent qualities, will not mind others spending time with you,","and in fact will be deeply suspicious of an unwillingness to do so, which he will take as a sign of their wanting to have nothing to do with him, while he will think of the benefit he could gain from those who do spend time with you. The upshot is that a non-lover can be far more hopeful of gaining friendship rather than antagonism as a result of the affair.","Also, it is commonly the case that a lover desires his beloved's body before he has come to appreciate his character or got to know his other attributes.","This should make the beloved wonder whether a lover will still want to be his friend when his desire has come to an end.","A couple who are not in love, however, were friendly with each other even before they consummated their affair, and the favours they do each other are unlikely to lessen their friendship, but are more likely to remain as indicators of more to come in the future.","Also, you can expect to become a better person if you listen to what I say than if you listen to a lover.","A lover praises the things his beloved says and does even when they do not conform with morality, partly because he is afraid of being disliked, partly because his judgement is impaired by his desire.","After all, here are some typical manifestations of love.","Love makes a lover count as disastrous setbacks which cause no one else any distress at all, and when things are going well love compels him to praise even things which ought not to give him pleasure.","Pity, then, rather than admiration, would be a far more appropriate response for a beloved to show a lover.","But if you listen to me, first, when I am with you, I will not be a slave to immediate pleasure, but will look to the beneficial future results of our relationship; I will not be overcome by love, but will be in control of myself;","I will not let trivia arouse me to violent hostility, though important issues will gradually make me a little angry; I will forgive unintentional errors and try to stop you making intentional mistakes before they happen.","This all goes to show that our relationship would last a long time.","If it happens to have occurred to you that there can be no real warmth in a relationship unless your partner is in love, you should bear in mind that, if this were so, we would not value our sons or parents,","nor would we have good friends, whose friendship does not depend on the kind of desire a lover has, but on other aspirations.","Moreover, it follows from the principle that we should make a particular point of gratifying those who particularly need our favours, that in other respects too it is the most needy people, rather than the best people, whom we should be helping, since they will be especially grateful for their release from especially grim circumstances.","And the same goes for our private dinner-parties too: we should not invite our friends, but those who beg for food and need filling up, because it is they who will be appreciative, who will follow us around, call at our house, feel the greatest pleasure, be extremely grateful, and pray for us to be showered with blessings.","No, perhaps you should gratify those who are best able to repay the favour, rather than those who are especially needy; those who deserve what you have to give, rather than those who merely beg for it;","those who will share their own goods with you when you are older, rather than those who merely appreciate your youthful charms; those who will always maintain a discreet silence, rather than those who will boast to others of their success;","those who will be lifelong friends, rather than those who pursue you for a short while; those who will take the passing of your youthful charms as an opportunity to display their own good qualities, rather than those who will make the end of their desire an excuse for breaking up with you.","You should remember what I have been saying and bear this in mind: while in the case of lovers their friends tell them off for the depravity of what they are up to, no friend or relation has ever criticized a non-lover for letting an affair impair his judgement about what is best for himself.","Now, you might be wondering, perhaps, whether I am suggesting that you gratify every man who is not in love with you.","In the first place, I am sure that a lover would not tell you to have this attitude towards every lover either, because then the favours you grant would not deserve the same degree of gratitude from their recipients, nor, if you wanted to, would you be able to keep an affair secret from everyone else as well as you might otherwise.","In the second place, then, no harm should accrue from this business, but only good, for both parties.","I think that I have said enough to make my point. If you think I have left anything out and you want to hear further arguments, you have only to ask.","So how does the speech strike you, Socrates? Isn't it extraordinary, especially in its use of language?"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Yes, it's out of this world, my friend. I was amazed.","And you were the reason I felt this way, Phaedrus, because I was looking at you while you were reading, and it seemed to me that the speech made you glow with pleasure.","Assuming that your understanding of these matters is better than mine, I followed your lead, and so I came to share the ecstasy of your enthusiasm."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Hmm... does it strike you as something to joke about like this?"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Do you think I'm joking?

Are we also required to praise a speech because its writer has included the necessary content, and not just because he has written a clear and compact speech, and has finely honed his vocabulary?","If we are, I'll have to take your word for it, because it went over my useless head.","I was paying attention only to the form of the speech, and I got the impression that even Lysias himself was dissatisfied with the content.","In fact, Phaedrus, unless you correct me, I thought he repeated himself two or three times, as if he had some difficulty finding a lot to say on the subject, or perhaps because he wasn't interested in such matters.","And so I thought that in an immature fashion he was showing off his ability to say the same thing in two different ways and to find both times an excellent way of expressing himself."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["You're talking nonsense, Socrates.

These points are essential to the argument: do you think anyone would say anything different? No, I think we should ignore points of this kind and forgive the speaker for making them.

Once upon a time there was a boy, or rather a young man, who was very beautiful, and he had a great many lovers. One of these lovers was a cunning man, and although he was in love with the boy as much as anyone, he had convinced him that he was not. The time came when, in order to try to seduce the boy, he set about persuading him of precisely this point, that he should gratify a non-lover rather than a lover. And this is what he said: 'Whatever the issue, my young friend, if you want to come to a correct conclusion there is only one place to start your deliberations. If you lack knowledge of whatever it is you are thinking about, you are bound to go wrong. Now, most people fail to appreciate their ignorance of the true nature of any given thing, proceed on the assumption that they do know, and end up paying the penalty you'd expect, of agreeing neither with themselves nor with anyone else. I don't want you and me to experience what we criticize in others. No, because the issue before us is whether one should enter into a relationship with a lover or a non-lover, we should establish a mutually acceptable definition of love\u2014of what kind of thing it is, and what its powers are\u2014and then we can conduct our enquiry into whether it is beneficial or harmful with this definition before us as a benchmark and a point of reference. 'Well, then, it is clear to everyone that love is a kind of desire, and we also know that even non-lovers desire the beauty in people and things. So how shall we tell a lover from a non-lover? We must next bear in mind that in each of us there are two ruling and guiding forces whose lead we follow: one is our innate desire for pleasures, and the other is an acquired mode of thought, which aims for what is best. These two forces in us sometimes work together, but sometimes conflict, and at different times one or the other of them is in command. When thought is in command and is leading us rationally towards what is best, the name we give to its rule is self-control. When desire is in command and is dragging us irrationally towards pleasures, we call its rule excess. Now, excess has many names, because it is a thing of many limbs and parts, and a person in its grip gains an ugly, pejorative name according to which of the many types of excess happens to dominate at the time. When the desire for food conquers one's reasoning about what is best and overpowers the other desires, it is called gluttony and someone in its grip gains exactly that name. Or again, when someone is ruled by the desire for alcohol and is led in that direction, we all know what name he gains for himself. And so on: in the case of all the related names of these and related desires, we can easily see that people are called by the appropriate name, depending on whichever desire is in control. We are already more or less in a position to understand the desire which all these preliminaries were leading up to, but it is always clearer to have something openly stated rather than leaving it implicit. So when irrational desire rules one's reasoned impulse to do right and is carried towards pleasure in beauty, and when this irrational desire has also been powerfully reinforced in its attraction towards physical beauty by the desires that are related to it, and has gained the upper hand thanks to this power, it is named after that very strength, and is called love.' Anyway, my dear Phaedrus, do you think I've been inspired by a god? I do."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Well, it's certainly true that you're being unusually eloquent, Socrates."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Keep quiet and listen to me, then. For in fact this spot really does seem infused with divinity, so don't be surprised if, as may happen, I become possessed by the Nymphs as my speech progresses. As it is I'm already more or less chanting dithyrambs."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["You're quite right."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["It's your fault. But listen to the rest of the speech. After all, the fit might be averted, I suppose. But we had better leave this in the hands of the gods, while we resume the speech to the boy. 'All right, then, brave heart. Now that we have stated and defined the matter we have to think about, we can refer to it in what follows and say what benefit or damage is likely to accrue from a lover or a non-lover to the person who gratifies either of them. A man who is ruled by desire and is a slave to pleasure is surely bound to see to it that his beloved gives him as much pleasure as possible. Now, someone who is sick finds pleasant only things which offer him no resistance, while he hates anything which is stronger than him, or just as strong as him. So a lover will not be happy with a beloved who is superior to him, or his equal, and he will always try to make him weaker and inferior. Now, a stupid person is inferior to a clever one, a cowardly person is inferior to a brave one, one who finds it impossible to speak in public is inferior to an orator, and a dull-witted person is inferior to a quick-witted one. A lover is bound to find pleasant the occurrence and the natural presence in his beloved of not just these terrible afflictions, but even more besides, and he will make sure that his beloved has them, so as not to risk losing his short-term pleasure. He is bound to be jealous, then, and because he stops him entering into a number of other beneficial relationships, which might have gone a long way towards developing his potential, he is bound to harm him a great deal, and a very great deal if he denies him the kind of relationship which would develop his intellectual capacities. This, in fact, would come about from the divine pursuit, philosophy, which a lover is bound to keep his beloved far away from, for fear of finding himself an object of contempt. And in general he will ensure that his beloved remains utterly ignorant and utterly dependent on him, in which state the beloved will give the greatest pleasure to his lover, but do the greatest harm to himself. Anyway, as far as the mind is concerned, there is no advantage at all in having as your guardian and partner a man who is in love. 'Next we must turn to your physical state and care of the body, and try to see how and in what way a man who is compelled to make pleasure rather than goodness his goal will treat a body which he is in charge of. You will soon see that he chases after someone who is soft, not hard, someone who has been brought up in hazy shade rather than in the pure light of the sun and who has no experience of manly toil and dried sweat, but has plenty of experience of a comfortable and effeminate way of life, someone who prettifies himself with alien colours and make-up because he has none of his own, and whose other pursuits are all in keeping with those we have already mentioned. They are obvious and there is nothing to be gained by adding to the list, but we can move on once we have briefly stated the main point: in times of war and other important crises, a body of this kind encourages your enemies and dismays your friends and even your lovers themselves. 'All this is too obvious to need saying, but next it does need to be asked what benefit or harm the company and protection of a lover will do as far as possessions are concerned. Now, if there is anything of which everyone, but especially a lover, is aware it is that he would pray above all else for his beloved to lose his most precious, kind, and divine possessions. For he would gladly see him deprived of his father, mother, relatives, and friends, whom he regards as obstacles to and critics of what gives him the greatest pleasure\u2014spending time with his beloved. Also, in his opinion, the possession of gold or other valuables makes a boy less easy to catch, and less tame when caught, and from this it clearly follows that a lover hates it when his beloved has possessions, and loves to see him lose them. Then again, a lover would pray for his beloved to be without wife, children, and home for as long as possible, because he wants to spend as long as possible plucking the fruit he finds sweet. 'There are plenty of other evils, but thanks to some deity or other most of them do involve short-term pleasure. Take a parasite, for example: he is a formidable creature and a source of considerable harm, but he naturally involves a not unrefined kind of pleasure. Again, although one might criticize prostitutes as harmful, along with many other such creatures and pursuits, they are very enjoyable, in an ephemeral fashion. Not only does a lover harm his beloved, however, but there is no pleasure at all to be had in his company. After all, as the old saying says, youth pleases youth\u2014presumably because people of the same age have the same pleasures and this similarity makes them friends\u2014but one can see too much even of one's peers. 'Furthermore, in every walk of life pressure is a nuisance for anyone. And apart from the difference in their ages a lover exerts enormous pressure on his beloved. For in such a relationship the older man is reluctant to leave the younger at any time of the day or night; he is driven by compulsion, stung by a goad which, by constantly giving him pleasure when he sees, hears, touches, or otherwise perceives his beloved, induces him to find pleasure in being the boy's attentive servant. But what kind of consolation or pleasure can he offer his beloved to stop him being absolutely disgusted by spending all that time with him? He sees a face which is aged and past its prime, and everything else that goes with that, which it is unpleasant even to hear about, let alone being pressurized into experiencing the actuality of it. He is watched constantly and suspiciously in all his dealings with other people, he listens to excessive and inappropriate praise and to the same sort of criticism, which is intolerable when his lover is sober, and embarrassing as well as intolerable when he is drunk and talks with tiresome and unrestrained candour. 'A lover in love damages and disgusts his beloved, but once he has fallen out of love he is no longer to be trusted, for all the promises he made about the future, and for all the oaths and entreaties with which he accompanied those promises, as a barely successful ploy to offset the arduous nature of his company with the hope of advantages to come and so have his beloved stay with him for the time being. Later, then, when he ought to be fulfilling these promises, he swaps one internal ruler and master for another, and listens to sanity and common sense rather than love and madness. His beloved, however, does not realize that he has changed; he demands kindness from him in return for favours granted earlier, and reminds him of things he did and said, as if he were talking to the same man. The lover, meanwhile, is too embarrassed to admit that he has changed, and is also incapable of fulfilling the oaths and promises of the earlier, insane regime, because he has now come to his senses and recovered his sanity, and does not want to turn back into the same person he was before as a result of doing the same things as then. And so he tries to flee his responsibilities. Compelled to default by the change he has undergone, the former lover, at the flip of a sherd, turns to flight. The beloved is then forced to chase after him, cursing in his frustration, and completely and utterly failing to appreciate that he should never gratify someone who is in love and who is bound to be out of his mind, but would do much better to gratify someone who is not in love with him and is sane. Otherwise, he is bound to be surrendering himself to a man who is untrustworthy, bad-tempered, jealous, unpleasant, and harmful not just to his property and his physical condition, but even more so to his mental development, which is in actual fact the most valuable thing there is or ever will be in the eyes of both gods and men. 'All this, then, young man, is what you have to bear in mind. You should realize that kindness is not involved in a relationship with a lover. For him it is like food, just so that he can be filled up. Lovers love a young man like yourself as wolves love lambs!' That's it, Phaedrus. I have nothing to add to what I've said, and you must take my speech as ended."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["But I thought you were only halfway through, and would talk at the same length about the non-lover\u2014 about how it is preferable for the boy to gratify him\u2014and would explain all the advantages he brings. But you seem to have stopped, Socrates. Why?"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Didn't you notice, my friend, that I've stopped chanting dithyrambs and am now coming up with epic verse, even though I'm finding fault with things? So what do you think would happen if I set about praising the non-lover? Don't you realize that I'd certainly be possessed by the Nymphs to whom you have deliberately exposed me? I shall say only, in a word, that the non-lover has all the advantages opposed to the attributes we criticized in the lover. So what need is there of a long speech? I've said enough about them both. In this situation the tale I have told will meet with the appropriate fate, and I am going to cross this river and leave before you force me to do something even worse."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Not yet, Socrates\u2014not while it's so hot.

Leaving aside Simmias of Thebes, you easily beat everyone else.

I seemed to hear a sudden voice telling me not to leave until I have purified myself from some offence or other which I have committed against the realm of the gods. Now, I may not be a very good one, but I am a seer. I'm like people who are bad at writing: I'm good enough only for my own purposes. And so I do already understand beyond the shadow of a doubt what my offence was. After all, the soul too has something of the same ability that seers possess. Just now, when I was delivering my speech, something disturbed me, and I was rather worried, as Ibycus says, 'lest the cost of winning honour among men is that I sin in the eyes of the gods'. But now I see where I went wrong."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["And that is?"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["It was an awful speech, Phaedrus, just awful\u2014the one you brought with you, and the one you forced me to make."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Why?"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["It was stupid and almost irreligious, and speeches don't come more awful than that."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["No, they don't, if you're right."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Well, don't you think that Love is a god, and the son of Aphrodite?"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["That's what we're told."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["But that wasn't what we were told by Lysias, nor was it in your speech, the one for which you bewitched me into being your mouthpiece.

Not only did they commit this offence against Love, but their stupidity attained exquisite heights: although everything they said was unsound and false, they gave themselves solemn airs as if they were important, to see if they could deceive some pathetic people into admiring them. And so I must purify myself, my friend. Now, there's an ancient tradition governing how those who commit an offence in the domain of story-telling have to purify themselves, which Homer may have failed to recognize, but Stesichorus didn't. After losing his sight as a result of slandering Helen, Stesichorus didn't fail to recognize his fault, as Homer had. No, as a man of culture he recognized how he had sinned and immediately composed the following lines: False was the tale I told. You did not travel on the fair-decked ship, Nor came to the citadel of Troy. And no sooner had he finished composing the entire Palinode, as it is called, than he regained his sight. Well, I shall prove myself cleverer than them in one respect, anyway: I shall try to recompense Love with my palinode before anything happens to me as a result of slandering him, and I shall not keep my head covered out of embarrassment as I did before, but shall speak with my head exposed."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["You couldn't have said anything which would make me happier, Socrates."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["That, my dear Phaedrus, is because you're aware how shameless the two speeches were, the one given just now and the one read out from the scroll.

Here's what I have to say: '\u201cFalse was the tale\u201d that you should gratify a non-lover rather than a lover (supposing you have one), just because a lover is mad and a non-lover is sane. If madness were simply an evil, it would be right, but in fact some of our greatest blessings come from madness, when it is granted to us as a divine gift. For instance, the prophetess at Delphi and the priestesses at Dodona have done Greece a lot of good\u2014not only individuals, but whole communities\u2014in their madness, but little or nothing when they are in their right minds. And if we are to mention the Sibyl and all the others who, when possessed by a god, use prophecy to predict the future and have on numerous occasions pointed a lot of people in the right direction, we would only be lengthening our account with information that was already completely familiar. 'But it is worth mentioning as evidence that the people who made up our language long ago were also of the opinion that madness was not appalling or disgraceful. Otherwise they would not have linked this word, \u201cmadness\u201d, with the wonderful art of foretelling the future by calling it \u201cinsanity\u201d [manike\xaf]. No, they gave this wonderful art its name on the assumption that madness is fine, when it comes from divine dispensation, but people nowadays are ignorant of such nuances and so they insert the \u201ct\u201d and call it \u201cprophecy\u201d [mantike\xaf]. By the same token, when they named the investigation of the future by people who are in their right minds, which is carried out by means of birds and other signs, they called it \u201caugury\u201d [oiono\xefstike\xaf] because it gives the human mind [oie\xafsis] insight [nous] and information [historia] in a rational way, although nowadays people call it oio\xafnistike\xaf to make it sound more special with a long \u201co\u201d. So, because prophecy is more complete and valuable than augury\u2014not just because it has a superior name, but also because its achievements are superior \u2014those men of old were indicating that god-given madness is better than human sanity. 'Then again, madness enters certain famous families which have been afflicted by horrendous illnesses and suffering as a result of guilt incurred some time in the distant past, and with prophetic insight finds the necessary means of relief. It resorts to prayer and worship of the gods, and when, as a result of this, it comes up with purificatory rituals, it makes the madman better, not just temporarily, but for the future too. And so it finds a way to release people who are mad and possessed in the right fashion from the evils that afflict them. 'A third kind of possession and madness comes from the Muses. It takes hold of a delicate, virgin soul and stirs it into a frenzy for composing lyric and other kinds of poetry, and so educates future generations by glorifying the countless deeds of the past. But anyone who approaches the doors of poetic composition without the Muses' madness, in the conviction that skill alone will make him a competent poet, is cheated of his goal. In his sanity both he and his poetry are eclipsed by poetry composed by men who are mad. 'So there are some examples of the fine results of god-sent madness; I could mention even more as well. And the upshot is that we should not be afraid of madness, and should not be alarmed by the argument, designed to frighten us, that we should prefer a sane man over a passionate one as our friend. This argument can win the day only if it can also show that love is not sent by the gods to benefit the lover and his beloved. Meanwhile, it is up to us to prove, on the contrary, that this kind of madness is given by the gods to help us achieve the greatest happiness\u2014a proof which will be believed by the wise, if not the clever. 'First we have to understand the truth about the nature of the soul, whether divine or human, by considering what happens to it and what it causes to happen. This gives us the following starting-point for our proof. Every soul is immortal, because anything that is ever-moving is immortal, whereas anything which causes motion elsewhere and is moved from elsewhere stops living when it stops moving. It is only something which moves itself that never stops moving, because it never abandons itself. Such a thing is also the original source of motion for everything else that moves. Now, a source is ungenerated, because everything that is generated is necessarily generated from a source, but there is nothing for a source to be generated from. For if a source were generated from anything, it would stop being a source. Since a source is ungenerated, it is also necessarily imperishable, because a defunct source can never be generated from anything else nor can it bring about generation in anything else, given that everything is generated from a source. And so it is a self-mover that is a source of motion, and a self-mover can neither perish nor be generated, or else the entire universe and the whole of creation will inevitably run down and stop, and will never again find anything to act as a source of motion and generation. Now, we have already shown that a self-mover is immortal, and so no one need hesitate to claim that self-movement is the essence and principle of soul. For no body which is moved from outside itself has a soul, while every body which is moved from within itself, from its own resources, has a soul, since this is what it is to be soul. If this is so\u2014if souls and only souls are self-movers\u2014it necessarily follows that soul is ungenerated and immortal. 'That is enough about the soul's immortality. I must now say something about its character. It would take too long\u2014and beyond the slightest shadow of a doubt require a god\u2014to explain its character, but the use of an analogy will make the task within lesser human powers. So let's do that. In my analogy, a soul is like an organic whole made up of a charioteer and his team of horses. Now, while the horses and charioteers of gods are always thoroughly good, those of everyone else are a mixture. Although our inner ruler drives a pair of horses, only one of his horses is thoroughly noble and good, while the other is thoroughly the opposite. This inevitably makes driving, in our case, difficult and disagreeable. 'Next I must try to explain how one living creature is called \u201cimmortal\u201d while another is called \u201cmortal\u201d. It is the job of soul in general to look after all that is inanimate, and souls patrol the whole universe, taking on different forms at different times. A complete soul\u2014which is to say, one that is winged \u2014journeys on high and controls the whole world, but one that has lost its wings is carried along until it seizes upon something solid, and it takes up residence there. The earthy body of which it takes control seems to move itself, but that is the effect of the soul, and the whole unit of soul and body conjoined is called a \u201cliving creature\u201d, and also \u201cmortal\u201d. No one who has thought the matter through could call a living creature \u201cimmortal\u201d, but because we have never seen a god, and have an inadequate conception of godhood, we imagine a kind of immortal living creature, possessing both soul and body in an everlasting combination. Anyway, we can leave the facts of this matter to be and be expressed however the gods like, but we have to come to some understanding of what causes a soul to shed and lose its wings. It is something like this. 'The natural property of a wing is to carry something heavy aloft, up on high to the abode of the gods. There is a sense in which, of all the things that are related to the body, wings have more of the divine in them. Anything divine is good, wise, virtuous, and so on, and so these qualities are the best source of nourishment and growth for the soul's wings, but badness and evil and so on cause them to shrink and perish. 'The supreme leader in the heavens is Zeus. He goes at the head, in a winged chariot, arranging and managing everything, and behind him comes the host of gods and spirits, in an orderly array of eleven squadrons. For Hestia stays alone in the gods' house, while each of the other gods who have been assigned one of the twelve positions takes his place at the head of the rank to which he has been assigned. So there are many glorious sights to be seen within heaven, and many wonderful paths along which the favoured company of gods go and return, each performing his proper function, and the gods are accompanied by everyone who wants to join them and is capable of doing so, because meanness has no place in the gods' choir. When they turn to food and go to one of their banquets, they journey skyward to the rim of the heavenly vault. b Although the way is steep, the gods' chariots make light of the journey, since they are well balanced and easy to handle, but the other chariots find it hard, because the troublesome horse weighs them down. Any charioteer who has trained this horse imperfectly finds that it pulls him down towards the earth and holds him back, and this is the point at which a soul faces the worst suffering and the hardest struggle. 'When the souls we call \u201cimmortal\u201d reach the rim, they make their way to the outside and stand on the outer edge of heaven, and as they stand there the revolution carries them around, while they gaze outward from the heaven. The region beyond heaven has never yet been adequately described in any of our earthly poets' compositions, nor will it ever be. But since one has to make a courageous attempt to speak the truth, especially when it is truth that one is speaking about, here is a description. This region is filled with true being. True being has no colour or form; it is intangible, and visible only to intelligence, the soul's guide. True being is the province of everything that counts as true knowledge. So since the mind of god is nourished by intelligence and pure knowledge (as is the mind of every soul which is concerned to receive its proper food), it is pleased to be at last in a position to see true being, and in gazing on the truth it is fed and feels comfortable, until the revolution carries it around to the same place again. In the course of its circuit it observes justice as it really is, self-control, knowledge\u2014not the kind of knowledge that is involved with change and differs according to which of the various existing things (to use the term \u201cexistence\u201d in its everyday sense) it makes its object, but the kind of knowledge whose object is things as they really are. And once it has feasted its gaze in the same way on everything else that really is, it sinks back into the inside of heaven and returns home. Once back home, the soul's charioteer reins in his horses by their manger, throws them ambrosia to eat, and gives them nectar to wash the ambrosia down. 'This is how the gods live. As for the other souls, any that have closely followed a god and have come to resemble him most raise the heads of their charioteers into the region outside and are carried around along with the revolution, but they are disturbed by their horses and their view of things as they really are is uncertain. Others poke their heads through from time to time, but sink back down in between, and so they see some things, but miss others, depending on the resistance offered by their horses. The rest all long for the upper region and follow after, but they cannot break through, and they are carried around under the surface, trampling and bumping into one another as one tries to overtake another. So there is utter chaos, nothing but sweat and conflict. In the course of this confusion many souls are crippled as a result of the incompetence of the charioteers, and many have their wings severely damaged, but even after all this effort none of them succeeds in seeing things as they really are before having to return and rely on specious nourishment. 'The reason why there is so much determination to see the whereabouts of the plain of truth is not only that the proper food for the best part of the soul happens to come from the meadow there, but also that it is in the nature of the wings which raise the soul to be nourished by this region. It is the decree of destiny that any soul which attends a god and catches even a glimpse of the truth remains free from injury until the next revolution, and if it is able to do this every time, it will continue to be free from harm. But souls which fall behind and lose their vision of the truth, and are for some unfortunate reason or another weighed down by being filled with forgetfulness and weakness, lose their wings thanks to this burden and fall to earth. At this point they are subject to a law that they are not to be planted into the bodies of animals in their first incarnation. The souls which have seen the most are to enter the seeds of men who will become philosophers, lovers of beauty, men of culture, men who are dedicated to love; the second group those of law-abiding kings or military commanders or civic leaders; the third group those of politicians, estate-managers or businessmen; the fourth group those of men who love exercising in a gymnasium or future experts in bodily health; the fifth group will live as prophets or as initiators into one of the mystery cults; the sixth group will most suitably live as poets or some other kind of representative artist, the seventh as artisans or farmers, the eighth as sophists or demagogues, and the ninth as tyrants. 'In all these cases anyone who has lived a moral life will obtain a better fate, and anyone who has lived an immoral life the opposite. For no soul returns to the place it fell from for ten thousand years\u2014it takes that long for wings to grow again \u2014except the soul of a man who has practiced philosophy with sincerity or combined his love for a boy with the practice of philosophy. At the completion of the third thousand-year circuit, if these souls have chosen the philosophical life three times in succession, they regain their wings and in the three-thousandth year they return. But all the other souls are judged after the end of their first life, and once they have been judged they either go to prisons in the underworld where they are punished, or are raised aloft by Justice to a certain place in the heavens and live as they deserve, depending on how they lived when they were in human form. But in the thousandth year both groups of souls come for the allotment and choice of their second life and each of them chooses the life it likes. This is the point at which a human soul can be reincarnated as an animal, and someone who was formerly human can be reborn as a human being once again, instead of being an animal. For a soul which has never seen the truth cannot enter into human form, because a man must understand the impressions he receives by reference to classes: he draws on the plurality of perceptions to combine them by reasoning into a single class. This is recollection of the things which our souls once saw during their journey as companions to a god, when they saw beyond the things we now say \u201cexist\u201d and poked their heads up into true reality. That is why only the mind of a philosopher deserves to grow wings, because it uses memory to remain always as close as possible to those things proximity to which gives a god his divine qualities. By making correct use of reminders of these things a man, being constantly initiated into the most perfect rites of all, becomes the only one who is truly perfect. But since he is remote from human concerns and close to divinity, he is criticized by the general run of mankind as deranged, because they do not realize that he is possessed by a god. 'Now we reach the point to which the whole discussion of the fourth kind of madness was tending. This fourth kind of madness is the kind which occurs when someone sees beauty here on earth and is reminded of true beauty. His wings begin to grow and he wants to take to the air on his new plumage, but he cannot; like a bird he looks upwards, and because he ignores what is down here, he is accused of behaving like a madman. So the point is that this turns out to be the most thoroughly good of all kinds of possession, not only for the man who is possessed, but also for anyone who is touched by it, and the word \u201clover\u201d refers to a lover of beauty who has been possessed by this kind of madness. For, as I have already said, the soul of every human being is bound to have seen things as they really are, or else it would not have entered this kind of living creature. 'But not every soul is readily prompted by things here on earth to recall those things that are real. This is not easy for souls which caught only a brief glimpse of things there, nor for those which after falling to earth have suffered the misfortune of being perverted and made immoral by the company they keep and have forgotten the sacred things they saw then. When the remaining few, whose memories are good enough, see a likeness here which reminds them of things there, they are amazed and beside themselves, but they do not understand what is happening to them because of a certain unclarity in their perceptions. But although the likenesses here on earth (of things which are precious to souls, such as justice and self-control) lack all lustre, and only a few people come to them and barely see, through dim sense organs, what it is that any likeness is a likeness of, yet earlier it was possible for them to see beauty in all its brilliance. That was when\u2014we as attendants of Zeus and others of one of the other gods\u2014as part of a happy company they saw a wonderful sight and spectacle and were initiated into what we may rightly call the most wonderful of the mysteries. When we celebrated these mysteries then, we were not only perfect beings ourselves, untouched by all the troubles which awaited us later, but we also were initiated into and contemplated things shown to us that were perfect, simple, stable, and blissful. We were surrounded by rays of pure light, being pure ourselves and untainted by this object we call a \u201cbody\u201d and which we carry around with us now, imprisoned like shellfish. 'Let this be my tribute to memory; it was remembering and longing for those past events which has made me go on rather too long now. But turning to beauty, it shone out, as I said, among its companions there, and once here on earth we found, by means of the clearest of our senses, that it sparkles with particular clarity. For the keenest kind of perception the body affords us is the one that comes through seeing, though we are not able to see wisdom, because as with everything else which is an object of love, wisdom would cause terrible pangs of love in us if it presented some kind of clear image of itself by approaching our organ of sight. But as things are, it is only beauty which has the property of being especially visible and especially lovable. Anyone who was initiated long ago or who has been corrupted is not given to moving rapidly from here to there, towards beauty as it really is. Instead, he gazes on its namesake here on earth, and the upshot is that the sight does not arouse reverence in him. No, he surrenders to pleasure and tries like an animal to mount his partner and to father offspring, and having become habituated to excess he is not afraid or ashamed to pursue unnatural pleasures. But when someone who has only recently been initiated, and who took in plenty of the sights to be seen then, sees a marvellous face or a bodily form which is a good reflection of beauty, at first he shivers and is gripped by something like the fear he felt then, and the sight also moves him to revere his beloved as if he were a god. In fact, it is only concern about being thought completely insane that stops him from sacrificing to his beloved as if he were a cult statue or a god. 'Following this sight, the kind of change comes over him that you would expect after a shivering fit, and he begins to sweat and to run an unusually high fever, because the reception through his eyes of the effusion of beauty causes him to get hot. Now, this effusion is also the natural means of irrigating his wings. His heat softens the coat covering the feathers' buds, which had been too hard and closed up for wings to grow. As further nourishment pours in, the quills of the feathers swell and begin to grow from the roots upwards and to spread all over the under side of the soul, because previously the whole soul was winged. At this point, then, his whole soul seethes and pounds\u2014in fact, the soul of someone who is beginning to grow wings experiences exactly the same sensations that children feel when they are teething, with their teeth just starting to grow, and they feel an itching and a soreness in their gums. So the soul, as it grows its wings, seethes and feels sore and tingles. 'When it gazes on the young man's beauty, and receives the particles emanating from it as they approach and flow in\u2014 which, of course, is why we call it desire\u2014it is watered and heated, and it recovers from its pain and is glad. But when it is away from the boy and becomes parched, the dryness makes the mouths of the channels for the budding feathers close up and contain the wings' new growth. The new shoots are shut up inside along with the desire. They throb like pulsing veins, and each one rubs against its channel, with the result that the whole soul stings all over and is frantic with pain\u2014until it remembers the boy in his beauty and is glad. The strange sensation of mingled pain and pleasure is agony for it, and its helplessness torments it. It is too disturbed to sleep at night or stay still by day, and it rushes around to wherever it thinks it might see the boy who bears the beauty it longs for. The sight of him opens the irrigation channels of desire and frees the former blockage; it finds relief and an end to the stinging pain, and once more enjoys this, for the time being, as the most intense pleasure. This is not something it willingly does without, and it values no one more than the beautiful boy. It is oblivious to mothers, brothers, and all its friends. It does not care in the slightest if its wealth suffers through neglect. It despises all the customs and good manners on which it had previously prided itself. Indeed, it is ready to play the part of a slave and to sleep wherever it is allowed to, as long as it is as close as possible to the object of its desire. For as well as worshipping the boy who bears the beauty, it has discovered that he is also the only one who can cure it of its terrible suffering. 'This, you beautiful boy, to whom I am addressing this speech\u2014this is the experience men call love, but you are probably too young to think of what the gods call it as anything but a joke. I think that some Homeric scholars recite two verses from the unpublished poems of Homer which have to do with Love. The second of the two verses is quite outrageous and not very metrical at all. The couplet goes like this: He is the winged one that mortals call \u201cEros\u201d, But since he must grow wings the gods call him \u201cPteros\u201d. You can believe this or not, as you wish. But at any rate the background to and experience of being in love are as I have said. 'Now, if the captive is one of the attendants of Zeus, he can endure the burden of the Winged One with some dignity. But things are different when the servants of Ares, who made the circuitous journey in his company, are captured by Love. If they have the slightest inkling that they have been wronged by their beloved, they become murderous: they are quite ready to immolate both themselves and their beloveds. And so it goes for every single god: as long as he has not yet been corrupted and is living the first of his lives here on earth, an individual spends his life honouring and imitating to the best of his ability the god to whose chorus he belongs, and in all his dealings and relations, including his love-affairs, he conforms to this mode of behavior. So which good-looking boy an individual chooses as his beloved depends on his disposition, and he treats the boy as if he were that very god: he constructs for himself an image, so to speak, and decorates it in order to worship his god and celebrate his rites. 'The followers of Zeus, then, want someone with a Zeus-like soul as their beloved. They look for someone with the potential to be a philosopher and a leader, and when they find him and have fallen in love with him, they do all they can to develop this potential in him. If they have not undertaken such a task before, they set about it now, by learning from any available sources and searching by themselves. In hunting on their own for the nature of their god they are helped by the intense compulsion they are under of gazing on the god. Since they are in contact with the god in their memories, they are inspired by him and, in so far as it is possible for a mortal man to partake of a god, they derive their way of life and the things they do from him. And because they hold their beloved responsible for this, they feel even more affection for him, and as if Zeus were a well from which they draw water, Bacchant-like they pour it over their beloved's soul and make him as similar to their own god as they can. 'Those who were in Hera's company, on the other hand, look for a boy with kingly qualities, and when they find him they behave in exactly the same way with him. And the followers of Apollo and each of the other gods proceed in the same way, in accordance with the nature of their god, and look for a boy for themselves who has the same qualities as themselves. When they find him, they not only imitate the god themselves, but also, by means of persuasion and attunement, they get the boy to conform, as much as he can, to the god's way of life and characteristics. There is no malice or mean-spirited ill-will in their dealings with their beloveds. No, they behave as they do because they are trying their utmost to get the boy completely and utterly to resemble themselves and the god to whom they are dedicated. What true lovers are committed to, the consummation of their quest\u2014at any rate, if they attain their goal in the way I have been describing\u2014thus becomes admirable and a way for someone who is maddened by love to secure the happiness of the object of his affection, if he captures him. 'I will now describe how a captive is caught. Let's stick to the threefold division of the soul we made at the start of this tale, with each and every soul consisting of two horse-like aspects and a third like a charioteer. Now, we said that one of the horses was good and the other bad, but we did not describe the goodness of the good one and the badness of the bad one. We must do so now. The one in the better position has an upright appearance, and is clean-limbed, high-necked, hook-nosed, white in colour, and dark-eyed; his determination to succeed is tempered by self-control and respect for others, which is to say that he is an ally of true glory; and he needs no whip, but is guided only by spoken commands. The other is crooked, over-large, a haphazard jumble of limbs; he has a thick, short neck, and a flat face; he is black in colour, with grey, bloodshot eyes, an ally of excess and affectation, hairy around the ears, hard of hearing, and scarcely to be controlled with a combination of whip and goad. 'So when the charioteer sees the light of his beloved's eyes, his whole soul is suffused with a sensation of heat and he is filled with the tingling and pricking of desire. The horse that is obedient to the charioteer restrains itself from leaping on its beloved, because as always it is held back by a sense of shame. The other horse, however, stops paying any attention to the charioteer's goad and whip; it prances and lunges forward violently, making life extremely difficult for its team-mate and for the charioteer, and compelling them to head towards the beloved and bring up the subject of the pleasures of sex. At first, these two get annoyed at being forced to behave in a way that seems dreadfully wrong, and put up some resistance, but eventually, finding no end to their troubles, they let themselves be led forward, and they passively submit to doing as they are told. And so they come close to their beloved and see the lightning-bright beauty of his face. At this sight the charioteer's memory is taken back to the nature of true beauty, and he sees it again in place on a holy pedestal, next to self-control. The vision terrifies him and he rears back in awe\u2014which inevitably makes him pull back on the reins as well with enough force to set both horses down on their haunches, the one willingly because of its obedience and the unruly one with a great deal of reluctance. 'After the two horses have withdrawn some way back, the good one drenches the whole soul in sweat brought on by its shame and horror, while the other, once it has got over the pain caused by the bit and its fall, scarcely takes time to draw breath before bursting out into furious abuse and hurling curses at both the charioteer and its team-mate for being cowardly and gutless deserters and defaulters. Once more it tries to force them to approach, against their wills, but it reluctantly agrees to their request to wait until later. When the proposed time arrives, it reminds them of their promise, while they both feign forgetfulness, and so, plunging and neighing, it forcibly drags them up to the beloved again in order to make the same suggestion to him as before. As they get close, with head lowered and tail out straight, it bites down on the bit and shamelessly drags them on. But then the same thing happens again to the charioteer, only even more strongly: he recoils as if from a trap and even more violently wrenches the unruly horse's bit back out of its teeth, splashing its curse-laden tongue and jaws with blood, pinning its legs and haunches to the ground, and causing it pain. Once the same thing has happened to it over and over again, the bad horse calms down, and now that it has been humbled it lets itself be guided by the charioteer's intentions. Now, when it sees the good-looking boy, it is frightened to death, and the upshot is that at last the lover's soul follows his beloved in reverence and awe. 'Not only is the boy now being treated as godlike and receiving every kind of service from a man who is not merely pretending to be in love, but does genuinely feel it, but also it is natural for him to feel affection for someone who is treating him so well. As a result, even if previously he had been put off by the assertion of his schoolfriends or whoever that associating with a lover was wrong, and had therefore repelled his lover's advances, yet now, with the passage of time, increasing maturity induces him to allow him into his company, and he is compelled to do so also by necessity, in the sense that it is fated that bad men can never be friends and that good men can never fail to be friends. Once he has allowed him in and has accepted his conversation and company, experience from close at hand of the lover's good will astonishes the beloved and he realizes that the friendship of all his other friends and relatives put together does not amount to even a fraction of the friendship offered by a lover who is inspired by a god. 'When the lover has been doing this for some time, and there has been physical contact between them at meetings in the gymnasium and elsewhere, then at last the flowing stream (which Zeus called \u201cdesire\u201d when he was in love with Ganymede) pours down on the lover in such great quantities that while some of it sinks into him, the rest flows off outside as he fills up and brims over. Just as a gust of wind or an echo rebounds from smooth, hard objects and returns to where it came from, so the flow of beauty returns into the beautiful boy through his eyes, which is its natural route into the soul, and when it arrives and excites him, it irrigates his wings' channels and makes his plumage start to grow, and fills the soul of the beloved in his turn with love. So he is in love, but he has no idea what he is in love with. He does not know what has happened to him and he cannot explain it. It is as if he has caught an inflammation of the eye from someone else and cannot say where it came from; he fails to appreciate that he is seeing himself in his lover as in a mirror. When his lover is with him, he finds just as much relief from his pain as the lover does; when his lover is not there, he misses him just as much and is missed just as much. He has contracted counter-love as a reflection of his lover's love, but he calls it and thinks of it as friendship rather than love. His desires are more or less the same as his lover's, though weaker\u2014to see, touch, kiss, lie down together\u2014and as you might expect before long this is exactly what he does. 'When they lie together, the lover's undisciplined horse makes suggestions to the charioteer and demands a little pleasure to reward it for all its pains. The boy's undisciplined horse has nothing to say, but in its desire and confusion embraces the lover and kisses him. It welcomes him as someone who clearly has its best interests at heart, and when they are lying down together it is inclined not to refuse to play its part in gratifying any request the lover might make. Its team-mate, however, sides with the charioteer and resists this inclination by arguments designed to appeal to its sense of shame. If the better aspects of their minds win and steer them towards orderly conduct and philosophy, they live a wonderful, harmonious life here on earth, a life of self-control and restraint, since they have enslaved the part which allowed evil into the soul and freed the part which allowed goodness in. And when they die, as winged and soaring beings they have won the first of the three truly Olympic bouts, which brings greater benefits than either human sanity or divine madness can supply. 'But if they live a more ordinary life, devoted to prestige rather than philosophy, it is certainly possible, I imagine, that when they are drunk or otherwise in a careless state the two undisciplined horses in them might find their souls undefended and bring them together, and so that they might choose the course which is considered the most wonderful of all by the common run of mankind, and consummate their relationship. Having once done so, they continue with this course of action in the future, but not often, because what they did was not approved by their whole minds. This pair too spend their lives as friends (though not as close friends as the others), not only while they are in love, but also when they have left love behind. They think they have exchanged vows of such enormous strength that it would be wrong for them ever to break them and fall out with each other. At the end of their lives, when they leave their bodies, they may not have any wings, but they do have the desire to gain them, and this is no small prize to have gained from the madness of love. For it is a law that those who have already made a start on the skyward journey shall no longer go into the darkness and enter upon the journey downward to the underworld. Instead, they live a life of brightness and happily travel in each other's company, and sooner or later, thanks to their love, gain their wings together. 'All these are the divine gifts you will gain from the friendship of a lover, young man. But since the companionship of a non-lover is tempered by human sanity, it delivers meagre and mortal rewards. It breeds in the soul of one of its friends a quality of slavishness which is commonly praised as virtue, and so makes it circle mindlessly around and under the earth for nine thousand years. 'There you are, dear god of love. This palinode is my gift to you and my means of atonement. It was as fair and fine as I could make it, especially in its use of poetical language, as insisted on by Phaedrus. Please forgive my earlier speech and look favourably on this one. I pray that you may be gracious and benevolent enough not to get angry and remove or impair the skill in love which you have granted me. Grant that those who are beautiful may value me even more than they already do. If Phaedrus and I said anything in our earlier speech which grated on you, please hold Lysias responsible, as the father of the speech, and make him stop putting words to this kind of use. Instead, have him follow his brother Polemarchus on to the path of philosophy, so that his lover here may no longer be in two minds, as he is now, but may wholeheartedly devote his life to Love and to the language of philosophy.'"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Socrates, I too pray that this may happen, if it really is better for Lysias and me. As for your speech, I found it very impressive throughout: it's so much better constructed than your first one. I'm rather worried, then, that Lysias may be humiliated, if he is even prepared to work up another speech to rival yours. The point is, you see, my friend, that just recently a politician was rudely finding fault with him for exactly that, and was using the term 'speech-writer' as a term of abuse throughout. So it may be that concern for his reputation will stop him writing speeches."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Phaedrus, you're making a fool of yourself in saying that.

They'd think that some slaves had come to this secluded spot of theirs to have their siesta by the stream, just like sheep.

When the Muses were born and singing had been invented, the story goes that some of the men of that time were ecstatic with pleasure, and were so busy singing that they didn't bother with food and drink, so that before they knew it they were dead. They were the origin of the race of cicadas, whom the Muses granted the gift of never needing any food once they were born; all they do is sing, from the moment of their births until their deaths, without eating or drinking. After dying they go to the Muses and tell them which men here on earth honoured which of them. They tell Terpsichore the names of those who have honoured her with dances and raise them higher in her favour; they tell Erato the names of those who have honoured her in the ways of love, and so on for all the other Muses, according to each one's area of responsibility. But they tell Calliope, the oldest of the Muses, and her companion Urania about those who spent their lives doing philosophy and honouring their particular kind of music. I should say that these two are the Muses who are especially concerned with the heavens and with the way both gods and men use words, and that there is no more beautiful sound than their voices. So there are plenty of reasons why we should talk and not fall asleep in the midday heat."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Let's talk, then."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["We had better look into the issue we just proposed for consideration, then\u2014what makes speech and writing good, and what makes it bad."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Obviously."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Now, if something is going to be spoken well and properly, the mind of the speaker must know the truth of the matter to be addressed, mustn't it?"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["What I've heard about this, my dear Socrates, is that it isn't essential for a would-be orator to learn what is really right, but only what the masses who are going to assess what he says might take to be right.

After dividing souls up in this way, 'There are so many types of speech, each of such-and-such a kind. People with such-and-such a nature are easy to persuade of such-and-such by speeches of such-and-such a type for reason x, while people with such-and-such a nature are hard to persuade for reason y.' Once our would-be orator has a good intellectual understanding of all this, he should next observe souls actually involved in and being affected by events, using his senses to pay keen attention to them, or else he won't yet be gaining anything from the discussions he heard at school. When he can not only say what kind of person is persuaded by what kind of speech, but also spot that kind of person before him and tell himself that here, in real life and before his eyes, is the kind of person and the kind of character which was the subject of those earlier discussions, and to which such-and-such a kind of speech should be applied in such-and-such a way to persuade him of such-and-such\u2014once he is capable of doing all this, and moreover has understood the proper moments for speaking and for keeping quiet, and can also recognize the appropriate and inappropriate occasions for concision, arousing pity, shocking the audience, and all the various modes of speech he has learnt, then and only then will his expertise have been perfected and completed. But if in his speaking or teaching or writing a person falls short in any of these respects, but still claims to be an expert speaker, the correct response is disbelief.

If you can offer any help\u2014you might have heard something from Lysias or someone else\u2014do please try to remember it and tell me."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["I would if trying was all that was needed, but as things are I can't, not just like that."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["So shall I tell you an argument I've heard from some of the professionals in this area?"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["By all means."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Yes, Phaedrus, because it's only fair to present the wolf's tale too, as the saying goes."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Then please do just that."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Well, according to these people there's no need for such a bombastic approach to the subject, nor for taking the long and circuitous route involved in referring things back to first principles, because\u2014as in fact we said at the beginning of this discussion\u2014there's absolutely no need for a person planning to be a competent orator to have anything to do with the truth where right or good actions are concerned, or indeed where right or good people are concerned, whether they are so by nature or nurture. They say that in the lawcourts no one has the slightest interest in the truth of these things, but only in making a plausible case; and since it is probability that enables one to do that, then this is what someone who plans to be an expert orator should concentrate on. In fact sometimes, they say, you shouldn't even mention what actually happened, if it is improbable, but make up a plausible tale instead, when prosecuting and when defending. Whatever kind of speech one is giving, one should aim for probability (which often means saying farewell to the truth), because rhetorical skill depends entirely on one's speeches being infused throughout by probability."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Socrates, that's a perfect account of what the self-professed rhetorical experts say. I mean, I remembered that we touched briefly on something like this before, but it seems to be the absolute crux of the matter for the professionals."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["But you've thoroughly studied Tisias' own words, at least, so let's have Tisias also tell us whether by 'what is probable' he means anything other than 'what the masses suppose to be the case'."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["No, that's exactly it."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["It was presumably after making this clever and professional discovery that he explained in his book what should happen if someone who is weak and brave beats up a strong coward, steals his coat or something, and is taken to court. Neither of them should tell the truth. The coward should deny that he was beaten up by just the one man, the brave one, who in turn should contend that they were alone, and then deploy the famous argument: 'How could someone like me have attacked someone like him?' The coward will of course not mention his own cowardice, but will try to come up with some other lie, which may give his opponent an opportunity to challenge him. And in every situation professional arguments will look something like that, won't they, Phaedrus?"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Of course."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Well, it certainly looks as though it was a wonderfully recondite profession that Tisias discovered\u2014or whoever else it might have been, whatever he likes to be called after. Still, my friend, are we or are we not to tell him..."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["What?"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["'In actual fact, Tisias, we've been saying for a long time, since before you came along, that this probability of yours actually takes root in the minds of the masses because of its similarity to the truth, and not long ago we concluded that in every sphere it is those who know the truth who are best able to come up with similarities. So we'll listen to you if you have anything else to say about rhetorical expertise, but if you don't we'll trust our recent conclusions. We said that unless a person had enumerated the characters of the members of his audience, and unless he could divide things class by class and take every individual thing, one by one, and see how it falls within a single category, he would never achieve rhetorical expertise to the extent that a human being can. But there's no way that he will ever gain these abilities without a great deal of effort. Now, a sensible person should not expend all that effort in order to speak and act in the world of men, but in order to be able to make speeches that are pleasing to the gods and to act, whatever he is doing, in ways that gratify them, to the limits of his abilities. For as I'm sure you're aware, Tisias, those of us with more than the usual wisdom say that anyone with any sense should not cultivate the gratification of his fellow slaves, except incidentally, but that of his masters, who are thoroughly good. So you shouldn't be surprised if the route is long and circuitous, because the goals for which the journey is undertaken are important, not the trivial ones you suppose. Nevertheless, our argument claims that these trivial goals too will best come about as a result of a person's being prepared to pursue the important ones.'"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["I think your argument is truly excellent, Socrates \u2014if only one could put it into practice!"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["But if someone even attempts something fine, whatever happens to him is fine too."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["All right."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Is this enough on the subject of rhetorical expertise and its lack?"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Of course."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["But don't we still have to discuss whether or not writing is desirable\u2014what makes it acceptable and what makes it undesirable?"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Yes."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["So do you know the best way for either a theoretical or a practical approach to speech to please god?"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["No, I don't. Do you?"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Well, I can pass on something I've heard from our predecessors.

Please tell me what you say you've heard."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["All right. The story I heard is set in Naucratis in Egypt, where there was one of the ancient gods of Egypt\u2014 the one to whom the bird they call the 'ibis' is sacred, whose name is Theuth. This deity was the inventor of number, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy, of games involving draughts and dice\u2014and especially of writing. At the time, the king of the whole of Egypt around the capital city of the inland region (the city the Greeks call 'Egyptian Thebes'), was Thamous, or Amon, as the Greeks call him. Theuth came to Thamous and showed him the branches of expertise he had invented, and suggested that they should be spread throughout Egypt. Thamous asked him what good each one would do, and subjected Theuth's explanations to criticism if he thought he was going wrong and praise if thought he was right. The story goes that Thamous expressed himself at length to Theuth about each of the branches of expertise, both for and against them. It would take a long time to go through all Thamous' views, but when it was the turn of writing, Theuth said, 'Your highness, this science will increase the intelligence of the people of Egypt and improve their memories. For this invention is a potion for memory and intelligence.' But Thamous replied, 'You are most ingenious, Theuth. But one person has the ability to bring branches of expertise into existence, another to assess the extent to which they will harm or benefit those who use them. The loyalty you feel to writing, as its originator, has just led you to tell me the opposite of its true effect. It will atrophy people's memories. Trust in writing will make them remember things by relying on marks made by others, from outside themselves, not on their own inner resources, and so writing will make the things they have learnt disappear from their minds. Your invention is a potion for jogging the memory, not for remembering. You provide your students with the appearance of intelligence, not real intelligence. Because your students will be widely read, though without any contact with a teacher, they will seem to be men of wide knowledge, when they will usually be ignorant. And this spurious appearance of intelligence will make them difficult company.'"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Socrates, it doesn't take much for you to make up stories from Egypt and anywhere else in the world you feel like."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Well, my friend, the people at the sanctuary of Zeus at Dodona say that the original prophecies there were spoken by an oak. In those days people weren't as clever as you young ones nowadays, and they were so foolish that they happily listened to oak and rock, as long as they told the truth. But perhaps it matters to you who the speaker is, or what country he's from, because you are not concerned only with whether or not he is right."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["You're right to have told me off\u2014and, yes, I think the Theban king was correct about writing."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["So anyone who thinks he can get a branch of expertise to survive by committing it to writing\u2014and also anyone who inherits the work with the assumption that writing will give him something clear and reliable\u2014would be behaving in a thoroughly foolish manner and really would be ignorant of Amon's prediction, if he supposed that written words could do more than jog the memory of someone who already knows the topic that has been written about."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Quite so."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Yes, because there's something odd about writing, Phaedrus, which makes it exactly like painting. The offspring of painting stand there as if alive, but if you ask them a question they maintain an aloof silence. It's the same with written words: you might think they were speaking as if they had some intelligence, but if you want an explanation of any of the things they're saying and you ask them about it, they just go on and on for ever giving the same single piece of information. Once any account has been written down, you find it all over the place, hobnobbing with completely inappropriate people no less than with those who understand it, and completely failing to know who it should and shouldn't talk to. And faced with rudeness and unfair abuse it always needs its father to come to its assistance, since it is incapable of defending or helping itself."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Again, you're quite right."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Well, is there any other way of using words? Does the written word have a legitimate brother? Can we see how it is born, and how much better and stronger it grows than its brother?"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["What is this way of using words? How is it born, do you think?"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["It is the kind that is written along with knowledge in the soul of a student. It is capable of defending itself, and it knows how to speak to those it should and keep silent in the company of those to whom it shouldn't speak."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["You're talking about the living, ensouled speech of a man of knowledge. We'd be right to describe the written word as a mere image of this."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Absolutely. So here's another question for you. Consider a sensible farmer who cares for his seeds and wants to see them come to fruition. Do you think he'd happily spend time and effort planting them in the summer in gardens of Adonis, and watch them grow up in eight days, or would he do this, if at all, as a diversion and for the sake of a festival? Don't you think that for seeds he was serious about he'd draw on his skill as a farmer, sow them in the appropriate soil, and be content if what he sowed reached maturity in the eighth month?"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Yes, that's what he'd do, Socrates. He'd take care of the one lot of seeds and treat the others differently, just as you said."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["So are we to say that someone who knows about right and fine and good activities is less sensible than our farmer where his own seeds are concerned?"]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Of course not."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["Then he won't spend time and effort writing what he knows in water\u2014in black water\u2014and sowing them with his pen by means of words which can neither speak in their own defence nor come up with a satisfactory explanation of the truth."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["No, it's hardly likely that he will."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["No. He'll probably sow and write his gardens of letters for amusement, if at all, as a way of storing up things to jog his own memory when 'he reaches the age of forgetfulness', and also the memory of anyone else who is pursuing the same course as him.

But it's far better, in my opinion, to treat justice and so on seriously, which is what happens when an expert dialectician takes hold of a suitable soul and uses his knowledge to plant and sow the kinds of words which are capable of defending both themselves and the one who planted them. So far from being barren, these words bear a seed from which other words grow in other environments. This makes them capable of giving everlasting life to the original seed, and of making the man who has them as happy as it is possible for a mortal man to be."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Yes, this is certainly far better."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["With this conclusion in place, Phaedrus, we are at last in a position to reach a verdict about the other issue."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["What other issue?"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["The one that brought us here. We wanted to investigate why Lysias was abused for writing speeches, and the expert or inexpert composition of the actual speeches. Well, I think we've made it fairly clear what makes for expertise and its lack."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["I thought so, but could you remind me again?"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["First, someone has to know the truth of every matter he's speaking or writing about, which is to say that he has to be capable of defining a whole as it is in itself and then know how to divide it up class by class until he reaches something indivisible. He also has to be able to distinguish souls in the same sort of way, discover the kind of speech which naturally fits each kind of soul, and organize and arrange his speeches accordingly\u2014offering a complex soul a complex speech which covers the whole range of modes, and a simple soul a simple speech. Until he can do all this he will be incapable of tackling speeches in as much of a professional manner as their nature allows, either for teaching or for persuasion. This is what the whole of our earlier discussion has shown us."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["Yes, absolutely. That's pretty much what we found."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["So what about the question whether or not it is acceptable to deliver or write speeches, and under what circumstances it would or would not be fair to describe it as a shameful activity? Haven't our recent conclusions shown..."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["What conclusions?"]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["...that if Lysias or anyone else who has in the past written a speech, or will write one in the future, for private or public consumption\u2014that is, in the latter case, when proposing legislation and so composing a political speech\u2014thinks there is any great degree of reliability and clarity in it, this is a source of shame for the author, whether or not anyone has ever said as much to him. For, awake or asleep, ignorance about what activities are right and wrong and good and bad cannot, when seen aright, fail to be a matter for reproach, even if the general mass of people approve of it."]},{character:l.Phaedrus,speech:["I quite agree."]},{character:l.Socrates,speech:["But consider someone who thinks that, whatever the subject, a written speech is bound to be largely a source of amusement, and that no speech which has ever been written in verse or in prose deserves to be taken seriously; that the same goes for the declamations of rhapsodes, which are designed to produce conviction, but allow no cross-examination and contain no element of teaching; that in actual fact the best speeches do no more than jog the memories of men of knowledge; that clarity and perfection and something worth taking seriously are to be found only in words which are used for explanation and teaching, and are truly written in the soul, on the subject of right and fine and good activities; that, while he ignores all the rest, words of this kind should be attributed to him as his legitimate sons\u2014 above all the words within himself, if he has found them and they are there, but secondly the words that are at once the offspring and the brothers of these internal ones of his, and have duly grown in others' souls.
